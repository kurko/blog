These are foundational topics for one-on-one's. They are the first ones I bring for discussion every week to set out the background for the relationship that will follow. They are not the definitive list of topics for one-on-one's, but the most important ones for starting out.

Some subjects are about meeting in the middle and learning about each other. On the other hand, some are about being upfront and making some soft-promises to reassure them that you are worth their time. That is a double-edged sword because on one side, it can be dangerous if I fail, but on the other, it gives me focus on deliver on the promised. And promising and overdelivering is a powerful weapon.

Each topic is meant for a different one-on-one because they can be dense. It's ideal to keep each opportunity to one concept at max. However, some are _quickies_ and can be slotted alongside others.

All in all, our relationship is an enabler and core to our success. Relationship is, therefore, a recurring theme throughout.

## The List

The following markdown-formatted list can be copy and pasted in most todo apps.



Some of which aren't critical, and need to be timed correctly. If you have already been talking for weeks, or it's someone you already have known previously, these are too introductory and should most likely be skipped.
