excerpt: A little hack for improving hotel wifi.
---


**tl;dr** buy a gl-iNet wifi router; use it as a repeater and put it close to the room door.

In the past 10 years, traveling to many countries in many hotels, I’ve had country situations in which Wi-Fi was terrible at. For someone who is working constantly, even when traveling, that’s a huge burden and source of stress due to the uncertainty on what the Internet quality is going to be like, it’s not like something that can be easily researched ahead of time because even if you ask the hotel, they will say that it is good.

This is usually due to two problems, one of which can be improved quite substantially: bad internet or bad wifi. We can’t really fix the Internet if the provider is offering a bad service to the hotel. We would have to actually go and change physical, harder hardware, perhaps inside or outside the hotel.

The second problem is the actual Wi-Fi signal, which is something the people usually ignore, but is generally the major cause of issues. 



## How Wifi Signal works

if you don’t know how this works, you can think of packets of data to go in and out of your computer to the antenna when the antenna is far away, order, thick walls in between your device and the antenna, some of these packets get lost, and never reach or arrive in the antenna or your device. For videos this is generally fine, because when packets are lost, your device will request them again, and your video player will buffer, or in other words it will store more packets, then you need right now, so that, even if you lose some of them, your video can continue playing. That doesn’t work for meetings in zoom calls for example, because in that situation you need to pack it right now because it’s in real time, so when we lose one, your video will actually freeze.

There are several ways to check the quality of the signal, but the one that I usually do more often is opening a terminal in running binggoogle.com, which will show each package that is sent and received, and for the lines that are blank, it means that respective sent packet, never returned, therefore it was lost.  When you run it over a period of a minute, you’re going to see that he will either work 100% of the time or it will have a percentage of those packets lost, and that’s when you know that you were going to have problems in your zoom calls.
