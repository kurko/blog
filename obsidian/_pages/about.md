Hi 👋 I'm Alex Oliveira. 👨‍💻 I make software. 

For over 15 years, as an engineer, systems architect and engineering lead, I
coded and led teams in:

<ul class="no-bullets">
  <li> 🛍 e-commerce platforms</li>
  <li> 🏦 banking systems</li>
  <li> 💳 credit card gateways/storage</li>
  <li> 🗣 advertising services</li>
  <li> 🚕 geolocated ridesharing apps</li>
  <li> 🚌 transportation platforms</li>
  <li> 💰 fintechs</li>
  <li> 💻 software intelligence</li>
</ul>

I spoke at RubyConfs, Euruko, universities, and more. I believe [good writing is an act of empathy](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher/pull/36/files#diff-c49cb89b66bc4961c47c867b709bcb7956c00bff469ff5ad622be0a0e73c5dd2R94-R124).
