Over the years, I learned some specific activities transport me above my reality plane, to a state I call transcendental. Some are more mundane things like driving or sipping coffee in a cold forest, but others cause states including awe or gratitude. Some are bizarre and intimate while others are simple. 

When those states happen, I'm still physically looking through my eyes, but the imaginations that intrude my mind are sort of stronger than my senses and superimpose my visual field. 

Here's a rough summary:

- Specific instrumental song segments put me in a sort-of trance moment. It's rare, ultra specific and bizarre. It's probably very similar to how one feels experiment psychedelics.
- Coffee brew in a cold saturday morning.
- Driving  with high volume music makes time pass slower. That is just adrenaline, but the caveat here is that due to the physical movement prior to the hormone being liberated in the blood stream, I can feel the time speed transitioning from fast to slow.


These are notes on those things. 

## Music

Specific instrumental song segments paired with excellent headphones put me in a sort-of trance moment. It's ultra rare. Some of them get me in a emotional state that I never get into any other way, while others makes me feel like in front of some deity. It's bizarre. It's probably very similar to how one feels experiment psychedelics.

This only works if I have excellent headphones, from Airpods Max and up. I've tried with Sony WH-1000XM4 and similar and it gets me like 60% there, but not quite.

#### Gap, by Hans Zimmer (0:55 - 2:40)

The segment in question is 0:55-2:40 ([YouTube link](https://youtu.be/AetAIRtV-Wc?t=55)). This is the image and reality that flashes through my mind when listening to this segment.

> A helicopter sounds muffled in the horizon, but muffled because person is self-absorbed on its own mind. Despite screaming externality, there's internal progress through struggles.
> 
> The background as if person is sailing into the horizon, with culmination into peace, later danger.

The song continues and I'd love if the danger part at the end didn't exist there.
