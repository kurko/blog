2024-02-09 NVIDIA stock ($NVDA) just hit $719, and it feels like a huge bubble. $1.7T in market capitalization is insane. It's 1/20 the US' GDP, greater than that of Switzerland. I recall it hitting $300 less than a year ago and it felt like a stretch given the market fear of recession at the time.

We probably shouldn't conflate market cap with an investment fund for building chip factories, but [Sam Altman is trying to raise $7T to build AI chips](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0) because he "often complained that there aren’t enough of these kinds of chips". 

That's 4x the current NVIDIA's market cap. Does that mean NVIDIA's bubble is actually cheap? Probably not because that fund would be used over a long period of time, whereas the stock's $1.7T is formed by speculative money. It's counter-intuitive, to say the least.  

In the absolute, it looks like a bubble. You zoom into the chart and it's sort of insane. But when you zoom out and consider that it has been growing at the same rate since 2015-2016 era, consistently staying within a bounded trend up, it doesn't look like it's about to pop. In that lens, it's sort of incredible that LLMs (these speaker AIs) have appeared right along the way, boosting NVIDIA even higher.

If I had cash lying around, I would invest into it, probably not 100% of that because I also believe there's downward risk with anything that seems to grow too fast (return to the mean etc). Right now I have other investments that are good and when factoring removing those positions in favor of NVIDIA, it doesn't look that attractive. But what do I know, this is all feelings and guesses.

2023-12-26 Started fasting, objective is 72 hours.  

T-3: my pre-fasting plan has been to avoid alcohol and carbohydrates. My dinner is going to be cheese, some charcuterie, tomatoes, perhaps some integral bread. It's important to note that I don't eat a lot of carbohydrates, and that's a big factor in feeling hunger.
T+0: it’s 8pm, Christmas day. Finished my meal 10 minutes ago.
T+16: it’s noon and I had my first cup of coffee. This would coincide with finishing lunch. 
T+18: hungry, sleepy. 
T+20: feeling really great. It’s probably because I just had electrolytes, which from experience wakes up my mind. A little bit of hunger though, almost imperceptible, and dry mouth. Been drinking water but not tons. Should probably increase intake. (4pm)
T+26: it's 10pm and I'm feeling super anxious about eating. Not hungry, just anxious (ok, just tad bit hungry). I opened the fridge instinctively a few times, and have made restaurant plans with my wife. Drank tons of water but after an hour without it, my mouth is very dry again.
T+27: a little bit of nausea, but drinking water makes it go away. Aside from that, my brain is working at full capacity, super clear thinking, no distractions. This is how I'd like my days to be like - except the hunger.
T+37: woke up today and I’m not feeling great. I feel extra groggy, a little bit of nausea and just lack of pleasure. Not feeling hunger, no pain, but I’m considering breaking the fast because there’s this lack of pleasure in just _being_. Ultimately I should enjoy life and there’s no reason to sacrifice even a day. Yesterday it was great, today not so much. 
T+38h27: broke my fast with scrambled eggs, a small slice of bread. The most amazing part is that I could feel the flavors much more vividly. The act of being myself in the present felt much stronger. What a contrast from just one hour ago. 

2023-12-26 Meetings tip: to make Zoom sound nice with an external mic, use Musician mode. Zoom's noise cancellation feature decreases audio quality by a lot. Second, turn on MacOS' voice isolation, which replaces Krisp and Zoom's noise cancellation, without losing noticeable quality.

2023-11-11 A couple months ago in a cabin in the Swiss alps, a tool shed had a vinyl player with some Miles Davis records. I’ve never felt any special sentiment towards vinyl nor understood why some people have. When it started playing, the trumpet filled the room with 1955. Looking through the window, I traveled back and forth through history in milliseconds. Now I think about that moment, and whether buying a record player in home base Brazil will bring me back to 1955, or to a Swiss alp memory. 

2023-07-04 After listening to George Hotz on Lex, I got an itchy feeling about my career, my hobbies and priorities. I love my career, I'm lousy about my hobbies, but I have not been prioritizing the things I used to love. When I was younger I used to love computers, but that has been completely forgotten. It's like loving cars and then becoming a cab driver. Listening to cool stuff he's been doing with low-level code and building Tinygrad, my mind went "wow I used to love this stuff, where's all that?". I realized I need to step back and rethink priorities, side projects, and keep a vigilant eye on my career. It's fine to work as a manager or be a cab driver, but I need to find ways to get back into the garage and play mechanic.
