2023-07-04 After listening to George Hotz on Lex, I got an itchy feeling about my career, my hobbies and priorities. I love my career, I'm lousy about my hobbies, but I have not been prioritizing the things I used to love. When I was younger I used to love computers, but that has been completely forgotten. It's like loving cars and then becoming a cab driver. Listening to cool stuff he's been doing with low-level code and building Tinygrad, my mind went "wow I used to love this stuff, where's all that?". I realized I need to step back and rethink priorities, side projects, and keep a vigilant eye on my career. It's fine to work as a manager or be a cab driver, but I need to find ways to get back into the garage and play mechanic.
