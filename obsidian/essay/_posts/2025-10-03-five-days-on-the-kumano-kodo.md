TODO
- There's too much "we're uncertain" in the text. It's looking like we're cowards, which is not the case. We're just thinking too much. Overthinking. I want to dampen it, ease that.
- Lazy images are taking longer to load on mobile (zrok) and causing blank squares to show up as I scroll.
- I want to include somewhere, perhaps in the end, that I thought the temples were the destination, but in doing the pilgrimage, I learned that the destination is the walk itself.
-->

For thousands of years, the *Kumano Kodo* (熊野古道) trails in Japan have guided pilgrims toward sacred temples and connected walkers in search of meaning, or just adventure. While walking those paths for five days in search of the latter, I may have stumbled upon a little of the former.

The idea of a total reset had been circling my mind for some time, a need to disconnect from routine, tune out the noise, and reconnect with my own thoughts. The *Kumano Kodo* felt like the right backdrop for that experiment. I assumed the effort would be rewarded by shrines. I didn’t know yet that the walk itself would become the destination, and each step a small arrival.

The absence of Switzerland's turquoise lakes or the dramatic Alps of France meant the landscape wouldn't steal the spotlight, it would walk beside me instead, a quiet companion. Yet, by the final day, all I wanted was to start again. Those soft, green mountains held more beauty than I expected.

From the start, this had to be a distraction-free walk. Even when the idea was still forming, it was clear that I wanted full immersion: no social media, no podcasts, no music. Just the here and the now. No autopilot, only awareness.

## Day 1: Takijiri-oji to Chikatsuyu
<span class="subtitle">Finding the rhythm of the path</span>

It's 9am, September 29. My wife and I are in *Takijiri-oji* (滝尻王子), where our walk begins. Our <a href="https://www.balsamicojam-nankiwakayama.com/kumano-winery-guest-house" target="winery-airbnb">Airbnb host</a> just dropped us off in a minivan. The hamlet looks neat but unremarkable, like others we passed on the way. The mountains and forests, though, are imposing and seemingly impenetrable.

*"Is one of these the one we'll climb?"*, is one question that pops in my mind. At first glance, they look quite steep. The night before, a guest who walked from *Takijiri-oji* to *Takahara* (高原) invested time in an attempt to persuade us to skip it. I sipped wine and shrugged, *"where would the fun be in that? I travelled around the planet for this"*.

Around the planet, indeed. Residing in Brazil, we planned a stopover in the US to dilute the hardship. The journey from Denver until arrival in *Tanabe* the night before was pure chaos, a tight schedule with endless potential points of failure. More on that later, however, because my eyes must now focus on these mountains.

The walk starts off climbing a staircase with steps twice the regular height. At first, I'm enchanted by the beauty and historical significance. *"Lots of photography opportunities"*, I think. You don't commonly see rocky stairs intertwined with tree roots like these anywhere.

However, the staircase *never stops*. We're ten, thirty, fifty minutes in and it's an endless, tough ascend. After two hundred meters of elevation, my body is protesting loudly, *"what the hell are you doing, Alex?"*. *"I didn't even have the time to wake up yet"*, it complains. The initial climb is sudden, dramatic and slow. 

After a while, the stairs morph into marble-sized little rocks. Every step is a meticulous task of positioning the foot properly, as if my ankles are dancing. The physical intensity is only matched by the mental challenge of choosing where to tread among the infinity of roots.

It rains lightly. A few drops overcome the protection from the trees.

After a brutal initial ascend, we reach a flat section where we can accelerate and keep a better pace. The watch displays 10:42am and 317m of elevation gain. After 3.44km, heartrate drops to 111bpm.

<div class="asterisks">***</div>

Half an hour later, we step on asphalt and arrive in a small hamlet that bifurcates the trail on to *Takahara* (高原, a short 1km trip), or to *Chikatsuyu* for another 8.5km, our original plan. The place has toilets, seats, tables, vending machine full of sold out drinks, a [cute cat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9tvZgwJ85RSh28TG7), and pay phone available. Lovely views of the mountains.

We feel uncertain about continuing. The forecast indicates rain and we feel the 514 meters of elevation gain was probably enough for the day. On the other hand, it's only 12:38pm, and if we can keep good pace, we will able to arrive at our next guesthouse before 5pm. The other option is taking a bus from *Takahara* to our next lodging.

I sip my coffee and shrug, *"where would the fun be in that? We travelled around the planet for the challenge"*, and we decide to continue.

<div class="asterisks">***</div>

As we get back into the trail to *Chikatsuyu*, we meet another steep ascend. This time, it's not a staircase, but a flat, slope surface that make your shin muscles burn. 15 minutes in and it feels extremely tiresome.

Being tired is fine. After all, we came here knowing we'd get exhausted, so I will skip the complaints about that. The challenge is watching my mind autonomously asking how long still to go before it gets easier, or how long for the pain to stop. That's not really useful thought, though. It's a waste of mental energy to ponder about things you can't change, or the path that has been planned a long ago. Where we are now is just a zone of discomfort and the right thing to do is to push the body forward. That's the focus that matters.

<div class="asterisk">***</div>

A layer of complexity (and exhaustion) added to this walk was how hectic our arrival in Japan was after a 10-hour sleepless flight. We had roughly 24 hours to arrive, travel 10h, sleep, pack, buy gear, figure out where to get bear spray. Please don't even get me started on the bear spray adventure. Then, in *Tanabe* the evening before the walk, we got a taxi driver that ignored our instructions and drove us elsewhere, causing all sorts of stress and we got to our Airbnb late. I mean, in the end everything worked out neatly, but it also felt like we were parachuting into the trail, like being dropped in the middle of a combat zone. It took us a while of walking to finally "cooldown" and get into the mental flow we came here for.

To add to the fun, my back hurts. It's fine, and I was expecting that, expecting it earlier. During my prep for this walk, my back had been bothering me quite a lot. For some reason it hadn't hurt for a while, but now it does.

And this heavy backpack is not helping, for sure. This is weighing 10-20kg. I decided to bring my laptop to unload my photos and write every night, to keep my mind going during these 5 days. That is definitely making a negative difference.

What helps me is engaging my core deliberately, like when someone's gonna punch you and you flinch. As my belly gets stiffer, I feel a relief in the middle of my back. So, overall, we're following the plan as intended, but I guess at this point, the decision is picking the less annoying annoyance.

A mile and a half into our trail, after beautiful forests and trails, we are welcomed by an incredible lake reflecting the trees and the sky.

There’s something beautiful and mysterious about this place. Pondering about how many people have walked these paths before, and all their experiences and the memories combined. Yet, here I am.

In the 11th century, retired Emperor *Go-Shirakawa* walked the Kumano Kodo thirty-four times. Emperor *Go-Toba* twenty-eight. It was while walking these trails in 1160 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori" target="_blank">*Taira no Kiyomori*</a> got word that his opponent, *Minamoto Yoshitomo*, had taken the opportunity to stage a coup in *Kyoto* (京都).

I have a sense of gratitude just for being able to start the trail, let alone finish it. Just to be able to dip my toes into a little bit of the history is a privilege.

The wrist watch shows 2:57pm and we made all the way to half of the trail to *Chikatsuyu*. A total of 05h06 so far, 909 m of elevation gained and 11km.

When comparing to the beginning of the trail, the worse part was later on. Contrary to what the *Tanabe Prefecture's* website says, that *Takijiri→Takahara* is harder than *Takahara→Chikatsuyu*, I found the opposite to be true! Well, I could also attribute that to the weight, energy and aggregated tiredness, which feels like has compounded a lot.

My left knee starts hurting. I end up using my hips for walking than the knees. It's lots of ups and downs, and in some places we have to almost use our hands to climb without falling. It just keeps going on and on and on.

My back is in a lot of pain now, but according to my calculations, we're two-thirds towards the end of today's trail, so now it should be only a descend all the way to *Chikatsuyu*, which should make our lives easier.

However, there is this annoying pain two inches below my knee when we descend. It's insistent and annoying. But it's fine, I understand, it's probably some weak muscle I ignored in the gym. A muscle that is never used until you jump into millennial hike, like the *Kumano Kodo*.

</figure>

We suddenly spot *Chikatsuyu* on the horizon, in between the trees, and enter the village by what looks like a backdoor, coming in from the mountains.

We arrive at around 5:40pm, 20 minutes before the only market around closes. We buy instant noodles for dinner along with some desserts, and eggs and bread for breakfast the next morning.

## Day 2: Hosshinmon-oji to Hongu
<span class="subtitle">Shrines, silence, awe</span>

We wake up in *Chikatsuyu*. This is the first proper morning in god-knows-how-long. Four days, I think. A morning to sit down and chill, without a burning need to get somewhere. The last night before our flight from Denver to Tokyo, I could barely sleep 2-3 hours, thinking non-stop about the trip, only to get up at 5:30 to head to the airport.

So, yes, we take our time. We take the deepest and longest inhale you can imagine. We stroll the village under blue skies to buy coffee, right before we jump on a bus to get to *Hosshinmon-oji* (発心門王子).

<figcaption>Slow stroll through Chikatsuyu</figcaption>
</figure>

The plan: walk down to *Hongu* (本宮). Most people just walk straight from here, but, presumably, the views as you descend from *Hosshinmon-oji* are nicer than starting in *Chikatsuyu*, so we will make that bet. We'll hop on a bus to get to the trail. Ultimately, the destination is the same.

<div class="asterisk">***</div>

*"What's going on here?"* I wonder, confused as I get on the bus. There's like what appears to be two hundred people inside. It feels chaotic and messy, and a thousand eyes are gazing at us. I sigh. *"I can't believe we're standing for a whole hour with these heavy bags!"*.

As we look around and try to figure out where to stay, humbly peeking over backrests in search of spots, I notice people are sitting on their luggages in the aisle, something I'd never seen before. It looks totally unsafe, but I won't judge.

A woman points at me and to the aisle, as if saying, *"You, stay there!"* I get even more confused. But, as I scan the corridor, I don't see any suitcase or luggage wheel. Wait a second! This bus has a fifth seat that folds from beside another seat, fitting five people per row! Japan really is the country of the future.

We walk on asphalt for 10 minutes before getting on to serious business. The trail is stunning. The modern road meets the old. Then asphalt and hamlets again, a symbiosis of community and nature.

The trail is breathtaking, and some spots seem to whisper, *"Please, stop and admire me"*. We oblige.

We slow down, gazing at the quaint hamlets, letting our eyes absorb the light like a sensor during a long exposure, etching memories onto a film of our minds. We want to remember this moment later, as vividly as possible.

The middle of today's trail gets challenging, like a game of Tetris, except it's your feet trying to fit the right spots. The staircases aren't built for regular steps. They're all over the place. There's a sense of continuous alertness and mild discomfort while walking. "The ankles need to be preserved at all costs", I repeat as mantra.

There are passages where my whole mental energy is focusing on where my feet are landing. Just that and nothing else. And then, at certain points, I pause and admire the beauty of what's around me.

I have seen millenar three roots serving as a long stair up and down. I have seen stairs made of rocks naturally. I have seen stairs with uneven steps. I have seen them all mixed, roots, rocks, sand.

The most impressive, however, are the ones that were crafted by the feet of the thousands and thousands of people who have,
a step at a time, helped shape this trail, the Kumano Kodo.

In between the woods, we spot what appears to be the outskirts of *Hongu*. Our expectation to see the tall *torii* gate grows exponentially.

We arrive at the *Hongu Taisha* area, respectfully appreciating the view of the shrine, and taking some time to admire banners, the architecture, the gold and silver.

On our way we continue, down the stairs that will lead to *Hongu's* streets, and the *torii* gate.

### Portals

After months of planning and preparation, we arrive at the imposing *Oyunohara* (大斎原) *torii* gate, the point around which our journey has orbited.

<figure>

</figure>

I feel like a tiny ant standing in front of this *torii* gate. It has great personal significance. I'll explain why.

Have you ever noticed how portals are everywhere in our culture? In *Alice in Wonderland*, the main character needs to go through a tiny portal to get to the *other side of her reality*. In *Narnia*, a hidden portal inside a wardrobe leads the characters to another world. In *The Matrix*, Neo passes a mental portal to wake up to the *real* world.

Some portals are conceptual, like event checkpoints. When *Einstein* discovered *Relativity*, the human race went through a portal after which life wouldn't ever be the same. *Penicillin*, vaccines, combustion engines, the printing press.

Portals are hard to be found. When you find them, you must make an intentional decision to go through. It takes effort. Once you do, your life is changed forever, and you can't fathom returning through it to your old reality. It'd be like death. Often times, you will come back to try and tell others where the portal is, but they downplay it, or laugh at you. You might try to tell them how it is like beyond the portal, the colors, the magnificence, but they won't understand because they haven't seen it for themselves.

In 2011, I crossed a portal. Living in a 5,000 inhabitants rural village in south of Brazil and with a 250Kbps bare internet connection, somehow I managed to get a disproportionally high-paying job in the US. On the other side of this portal, my life changed forever. I learned new ways of thinking, how to be productive, successful examples that challenged my education thus far, and how value is generated. For years, however, people thought I was a lunatic. You know, small town chatter. I tried to help others come through the portal, but they either couldn't find it, weren't willing to make the hard decision, or found it impossible.

Shinto *torii* gates captivate me because they represent a transition from mundane to a new reality, like the portals above. They are a celebration of the many portals distributed throughout space and time, yet hard to be found. They reward those who make the required decision to go through them, with a willingness to leave the past behind.

Being here has a special meaning this evening. This *torii* represents our quest for hidden portals. Quite possibly, having done this pilgrimage could mean I crossed another portal and my life will never be the same.

<div class="asterisk">***</div>

We sleep tonight in an Airbnb in *Hongu*.

## Day 3: resting in Yunomine
<span class="subtitle">Steam, river stones, and slowness</span>

We wake up to a chaotic morning, rushed and on empty stomachs. Google Maps had told us cafés and restaurants would be open today, but guess what, they were closed. Walking through streets on an empty stomach to find closed doors isn't fun. Fortunately, we stumble upon a small grocery store and throw together the quickest breakfast before check-out.

Today we'll head over to *Yunomine* (湯の峰), a small hot springs village. *Tsuboyu* (つぼ湯) is renowed as Japan's oldest onsen and a UNESCO World Heritage site. If things go according to plan, we'll chill, soak in hot water, and sit on a bench until our butts go numb. We'll watch the flights of birds, kids playing and trees dancing.

We are the only passengers in the mini-bus. We are dropped 40 minutes away from *Yunomine*.

We walk uphill on a hot and bright asphalt. The lack of shades on the road makes us stop a few times to cool down our body. It's 90F (32C). Who said this was going to be a rest day?

Half an hour, a relatively short walk, but my back already hurts nonetheless. This background discomfort is a recurring theme since the beginning of the journey. Two weeks ago in San Jose, back in the US, I turned to AI to help me diagnose the symptom. *"Alex, what you’re describing (tired, achy mid-back muscles next to the spine, not sharp or injury pain) sounds like muscular fatigue from postural stabilizers, the muscles that keep your torso upright"*. The knowledge that it's likely fatigue has given me confidence to continue the walk everyday, with the proper, systematic resting cadence. Still, it seems to get a little bit worse every single day.

We arrive to the small village and find empty streets. The central canal releases steam.

We drop our backpacks at a random spot and wander around to get to know the place. This is Japan, no one's going to steal your stuff. We roam around a nice, cute little village, then head to buy tickets to *Tsuboyu*, the famous, UNESCO onsen.

Honestly, I'm mildly reluctant to dip into almost-boiling water, given how hot the sun is. The *Tsuboyu* hut lets steam escape through its wall gaps, like a toaster made of wood. It's a mild sauna inside and the water is freaking hot. After several failed attempts to dive my toes, we finally soak, like two potatoes in the pan.

Before leaving the hut, I finish with cold water, which leaves a lasting freshness. My skin stays cold for a good hour or two afterwards during lunch. A small, wet towel wrapped strategically around my neck makes me feel like a relaxing capybara.

Our lunch involves doing the traditional *Onsen Tamago*, where you hard boil eggs by dipping them in an open hot spring for 11 minutes.

After lunch, we find ourselves a wooden bench to sit down and rest after lunch. As my legs touch the wood and I sit, it feels like *Rest Day* has finally began.

The tranquility invites us to play a little game to enhance our perception: Five things we see, four things we hear, three things we feel, two things we smell, one taste.

Treetops, children, traditional houses, flags, flowers. A breeze, a conversation in Chinese, children, birds chirping. Peace, privilege, sore muscles. Hot spring scent and flowers. Eggs.

We are hyperfocused on the present. A while ago I was preoccupied about making good use of the time, now my mind has calmed down. I'm just enjoying the wind blowing my skin.

Ice cream wouldn't be a bad idea.

<div class="asterisks">***</div>

We end the day in *Kawayu* (川湯), a tiny village where hot springs flow into the river. We wander the streets in robes and soak under a sky full of stars.

## Day 4: Kogumotori-goe to Koguchi
<span class="subtitle">Long ridges and thoughts</span>

We woke up to a gut punch before coffee. My wife's and my knees are hurting, and my back is doing a serious complaining, while today's trail is the toughest.

Let's orient ourselves, first with the setting. The 13km *Kogumotori-goe* (小雲取越) trail's first third is a gradual and continuous 470 meters climb to *Hyakken-gura* and scores 4 out of 5 in difficulty. It's harder than Day One, which was already quite taxing. Second, the risk: *Koguchi* (小口) has no lodging available today, so we must arrive before 5pm to catch the last bus to *Shingu* (新宮), non-negotiable. *Tanabe's* website says it's a 6-8 hour trail, which sounds feasible, but we're probably leaning towards 8 hours.

It's 7:45am and we deliberated for an hour. We concluded it's irresponsible to walk today with this much pain. The alternatives are doing a boat tour today (but I didn't come here to sit down); finding another trail (but that's frustrating given we planned _that one_ for months); my wife taking a bus to *Shingu* while I do the trail on my own despite the pain (but I'd feel bad for her, despite not caring that much about my discomfort); walking a third of the trail and returning, which sounds off-putting but it'd be better than nothing. None are satisfactory.

### Shipping weight

*"If only we weren't carrying our heavy backpacks"*, a lightbulb pop over ours heads. "What if we could leave our bags here and return"? That would be an inconvenient 16km return after a tired day of walking. *"What if we could ship more weight to Kyoto"*? That's not impossible. We would need a container and right now we only have two backpacks. I ask ChatGPT for ideas, *"why don't you check with the guesthouse's owner if he have a cardboard box you can use"*? Good idea. He does, indeed. He finds on in the trash, the perfect size.

We pack everything we can find our bags. The camera stabilizer stick, a camera, moisturizers, eyedrops. The lightweight laptop I'm carrying for writing. We tape it carefully, and there it goes to *Kyoto*.

We feel a little bit more optimistic, as if a ton had been lifted from our backs and our minds. The frustration is replaced with hope, we decide to keep the expectations low and set a simpler goal: walk 5 long kilometers to *Hyakken-gura*, the highest point, and re-evaluate. The peak is a third of the way, so it's presumably easy to get back if have to.

Once there, we will figure what to do next.

*Kohei-san*, the host, after solving our shipping and preparing a delicious breakfast, kindly offers to give us a ride to the trailhead with a smile from ear to ear.

### Back on trail

Twenty minutes into the walk. The adrenaline triumphs over any logical reasoning and make us both say, *"Fuck it, let's just keep going until the end of the trail"*. Ah, the overthinking! At least it served us in shipped weight, but did we need the drama? We laugh. *"It would be too frustrating to return once we're on the move"*.

It's 9:17am. We see humans beings on the trail, everybody faster than us. Our goal is reaching the peak of the trail in 2-3 hours, hoping we're left with plenty of time to continue on a slower pace.

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

I keep asking myself, *"Are we behind?"* I look at the offline map and I still have no idea where we are. We're walking fast and steady, like in a marathon chasing a gold medal. We feel like arriving at any moment. It feels also like the hardest trail so far. By a mile, figuratively and literally.

Five kilometers on a straight line would take me roughly an hour to walk, so the whole 6-8 hours the *Tanabe Prefecture* stipulates never made sense to me.

And if we get there ahead of time, say, before 11:45am, then we're gonna make a decision about going all the way. In theory, a third done in 2:45 hours means a total trail roughly 8 hours. The last two thirds would be downhill, which is presumably easier, but also terrible for knees like ours. 

If we got injured, could you imagine the inconvenience it would be? Waiting for someone to bring help? Nah, that's virtually impossible. A worst-case scenario looks like a slow zombie walking on a trail back to civilization. The scary is getting dark, no lights, nowhere to sleep, and then maybe I have my first ever homeless simulation. I mean, it wouldn't be the end of the world, but definitely not something I want to experience today.

### A new friend

Our conversation breaks off when we see someone walking backwards, moving slowly. I signal my wife to stay behind and go check out.

	<figcaption>A person on the trail.</figcaption>
</figure>

*"Hello? What's up?"* The woman looks at me. *"Uh... snake. A snake up there"*, she says, gesturing up the trail. *"Let me go take a look"*, I say, and move forward.

I scan the endless grass and leaf litter along the trail, but see nothing. Then, as I approach, the reptile glides down from the embankment above us onto the path, as if it wants to join our walk. As I close the distance, the snake angles across the ridgeline and disappears downhill. *"Clear!"*, I announce.

*"Would you like us to walk in front of you, just in case"*, I ask. *"Yeah, sure"*. We restart the march and I present myself and my wife. *"I'm Fey"*. My wife lags behind with her while I lead the group.

Over the next hour, a cultural exchange flows non-stop. We learn she's a Chinese kindergarden teacher on vacation, skipping the Chinese hiking trails this time to walk the Japanese ones. Yesterday, she walked up until late at night. *"It's common in China for people to hike in the middle of the night"*, she says. *"Aren't you scared of the dark or animals?"*, we ask. *"Yes, but we do it anyway. I use my cellphone lights"*.

Brave woman.

### The peak

Overcoming the struggle, we arrive at our checkpoint, the *Hyakken-gura*. I wonder if the clock is broken, it's 10:20am and nothing makes sense. *"How did we arrive in one and a half hours?"* We rushed, sure, but the terrain was the hardest we've experienced and our most optimistic plan expected at least two to three hours. Yet, we managed to get to our goal in half the time!

None of that matters now because the mesmerizing *Kumano* mountains fill my eyes. The green horizon casts a hypnotic spell, putting everything secondary.

</figure>

What a view.

---

We decide to continue on our way to *Koguchi*. We take a few more pictures, turn left towards the trail and... restart the march, as if any other option is inconceivable. At some point an hour ago we thought, *"Yeah, I just wouldn't feel good returning"*, and so we just kept going. After all is said and done, the decision is quick, based on gut and feeling.

And that's *fine*.

### Koguchi

The final descent is brutal on our knees, a continuous and relentless 2,260 ft (690 meters) drop. The steady rhythm of 3,750 steps pounds our joints like a pickaxe. The endless staircase forces frequent pauses, alternating pain with brief relief over an elevation loss equivalent to 225 flights of stairs.

My right knee shakes back and forth when I stand upright, like a column in an earthquake. We see a gradual increase in brightness among the trees. 

The end of the trail is near.

Exhausted, we reach the end of the trail at 12:10pm. We are thankful for having arrived. We head to *Koguchi* to find food.

Today, at some point we were pessimistic, then optimistic, then surprised, then hopeful, now satisfied. We made it.

I wonder whether we would have the energy to do the next trail right after, the *Ogumotori-goe* (大雲取越), which was known in ancient times as *Dogiri-zaka* (胴切坂), or *"body-breaking slope"*. Nothing less than a sudden 800 meters ascend in the first 5 kilometers.

Do I have the energy to do the second trail? Probably yes. Can my knees sustain a *body-breaking slope*? Certainly not. Everything hurts. I am destroyed, I'm tired, but I'm happy.

We arrive at a camping area that has a single a food truck, called *Bar Free Soul*. The owner serves us *gyoza* (餃子), and asks us to pin our country on a large map behind the counter. I raise an eyebrow the moment I see pins everywhere, except Brazil, before adding my pin.

We'll chill here until the next bus to *Shingu* stops by at 4:30pm. It's a long wait.

*Fey*, our new friend, rests for an hour before finally deciding to start the next trail toward *Nachi*, the *Ogumotori-goe*. We clap at this brave woman as she departs with her green backpack.

### Bear spray disposal

One big inconvenience is the bear spray, and disposing of it safely. Think of pepper spray, but on steroids. It shoots nearly 60ft (about 20 meters). It's an explosive red goo that you clip to your belt. You can't toss it in a regular trash bin, and you cannot fly back home with it either.

According to ChatGPT, Claude, Grok and Reddit (I quadruple-checked), the general guidance is to take it to a police station (*kōban*, 交番) and ask for help. Not exactly easy when you don't speak the language, and you'd rather not look like a lunatic with a canister in your bag.

Arriving in *Shingu*, I walk to the police station. Through the large glass door, I see no one inside. *"Out on patrol. Return later"*, the sign says. So I sit on a park bench nearby and wait an hour.

Then, two policemen appear down the street. I pack my things, ready the bear spray its bag and head toward the station. Just as I'm about the reach the door, the two officers sprint past me, jump into their car, flip on the siren, and race off to deal with something clearly more urgent than a confused foreigner holding a can of bear spray.

In Japan, manufacturers describe discharging contents either outdoors, or underwater in a bucket if that's not possible. Not really feasible from a hotel room. A problem for tomorrow<sup>1</sup>.

## Day 5: Shingu to Nachisan
<span class="subtitle">Long ridges and thoughts</span>

Our schedule is tight today because we're sleeping in *Kyoto* tonight. We need to catch 7:00am bus toward *Kii-Katsuura* (紀伊勝浦) and *Nachisan* (那智山). That gives us 8:51am to 10:32am to explore the temple and falls before five or six hours of trains to *Kyoto*. We cannot miss that bus.

But we wake up late. Empty stomachs, bags on our backs, and only 10 minutes to walk a 20-minute distance, we kick start our rushed walk towards the nearest bus stop north of us, which is impossible. Giving up, however, isn't an option. I pull up the map and spot a chance: the bus line curves through the city, so if we cut west, threading narrow streets like a needle, we might intercept it fourth stop. We hope the bus is slow, crowded even.

We walk the fastest 15 minutes of our lives and make it. The bus is coming on the horizon and the day is saved.

We arrive at *Nachi* station on an empty stomach, and depart to *Nachisan*. We head straight to *Nachi-no-Taki-mae* because we have no time to climb the *Daimon-zaka* (大門坂) stairs today.

---

I look at the clock when the bus arrives. It's 8:57am. As we step out, we reorient ourselves, among a crowd of visitors. Looking right, there's a *torii* gate leading to the *Nachi* Falls. Turning my head left, a staircase that leads to the *Nachi* shrine.

*Nachi-no-Taki-mae* is a bend in the road that feels compressed by traffic and guardrails. A small parking lot sits in the corner, a clutch of souvenir shops lines the curb, and a signed path leads towards the falls. Buses sigh, people reshuffle bags, and the crowd moves as on. It works as a waystation more than a place to linger, a stop where you wait to get somewhere better. A *liminal space*.

As we stroll towards the falls, can you guess who we spotted, out of the blue? Yes, *Fey*. We hug and rush to ask about her adventure yesterday, when she kept going after we stopped in *Koguchi*. *"It was hard! I kept walking until darkness, arriving around 10pm"*, she told us. Without a lodging reservation, she roamed around and was lucky to find an available room in a random guesthouse. *"Scary"*, she says with a nervous laugh about walking at night. *"I found a mother and her son in the trail, and we finished the route as a group together with our phone light. Then I knocked a few doors and found a spare room to stay."*

Brave woman.

The clock is ticking and we have to run. We say our goodbyes and rush to the stairs up to the temple. The first step feels like the hundredth and my thighs burn on the push. I reach for a handrail, but there's none. However, when I remember it's not an endless staircase, my shoulders loosen and I let out a breath. Today is short, we ought to make the most of it.

The stairs are made of rounded stones that seem to stretch beyond the horizon. It curves left and right. We stop to catch our breath and see the ocean in the distance fading into the cloudy sky, cradled by green hills. The village keeps getting smaller.

A few flights later, we lift our heads to the sky and glimpse vermilion in between the green leaves. Still faint, it imposes itself from above. Our destination draws near.

*"We're here, pinch me please"*, I ask my partner. We have arrived. The shrine's red, once only pixels on a screen, now fills my eyes. The water that ran behind this place a thousand years ago still runs, stitching past to present.

After days of walking on the Kumano Kodo, I finally let go of a breath I didn't know I'd been holding for years. My shoulders have never felt lighter, free from the weight from everyday's life. My chest feels full while I contemplate the satisfaction of achieving something bigger than myself. The walk has come to an end, but I feel the pilgrimage has only started.

I learned that the walk was the destination. Each step was an arrival, and the trail has become a metaphor for life.

## "Tomorrow"
<span class="subtitle">New paths</span>

After finishing the Kumano in the 12th century, the poet *Saigyō Hōshi* (西行 法師) wrote the poem,

<center>
<table style="background-color: transparent">
<tr>
<td>
吉野山<br />
こぞのしをりの<br />
道かへて<br />
まだ見ぬかたの<br />
花をたづねん
</td>
<td>
&nbsp;
</td>
<td>
<em>
Mount Yoshino<br />
I’ll leave last year’s marked path,<br />
take a different way,<br />
and search for blossoms<br />
in places I’ve not yet seen.<br />
</em>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

The poet’s vow to change the road resonates with me. It's an invitation to honor what was just walked, but to pivot and keep seeking "blossoms", insights, and wonders on new paths. It’s an invitation to carry the pilgrimage mindset onward, as a new person.

That’s what I’ll do.
