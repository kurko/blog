> "All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking." - Nietzsche

For thousands of years, the Kumano Kodo trails in Japan led pilgrims to majestic temples in Hongu, Shingu and Nachi, connecting all walkers of life in search of meaning, or just adventure. In search of latter, I found a bit of the former.

The notion of a total reset had been popping in my mind for a while, a certain attraction to disconnecting from routine and the world, reconnecting with myself and creative thoughts. The Kumano Kodo presented itself as an interesting challenge. Having traversed its paths, I feel renewed.

The Kumano looked a perfect match for that purpose. The absense of Switzerland-like turquoise lakes and French-looking alps meant the region wouldn't impose itself as the movie's main character, but as a pleasant companion for my journey. Fast-forwarding to the finish day, all I wanted was to start all over again. It was indeed a perfect match, though I underestimated the beauty I would find in those mountains.

My humble walk must be distraction-free, no social media, podcasts, music, just the here and the now. No autopilot, only being present. Photographs is sparse and intentional to avoid disrupting the flow.


## Day 1: Takijiri-oji to Chikatsuyu

It's 9am, September 29. My wife and I are in *Takijiri-oji* (滝尻王子), where our walk begins, after our <a href="https://www.balsamicojam-nankiwakayama.com/kumano-winery-guest-house" target="winery-airbnb">Airbnb host</a> gave us a ride in a mini-van. The small hamlet looks unsurprising, except for the mountainous scenary everywhere you look.

"Is one of *these* the one we'll climb?", is the question that pops in my mind. At first glance, they look quite steep. The night before, a guest who walked from *Tajikiri-oji* to *Takahara* invested a bit of time trying to persuade us to skip it. I sipped wine, shrugged and asked, "where would the fun be in that? I travelled around the planet for the challenge". I hope the fun is there.

<img src="/images/posts/2025-10-03-five-days-on-the-kumano-kodo/day1/L1001176.JPG" />

The walk starts off like climbing a literal staircase, except the steps are twice the height of a regular staircase. At first glance, it looks quite a beautiful scenery, "lots of photography opportunities", you think. You don't commonly see rocky stairs like these anywhere else. 

After 200 meters of elevation, though, my body protests, "what the hell are you doing, Alex?". "I didn't even have the time to wake up yet", it complains. The initial climb is sudden, dramatic and slow, and it rains lightly. Only a few drops overcome the trees protection. 

After a while, the stairs morph into many small little rocks intertwined with tree roots, making every step feel like my feets are dancing. The physical intensity is only matched by the mental challenge of choosing where thread among the infinity of roots.

After a brutal initial ascend, we reach a flat section where we can accelerate and keep a better pace. The watch displays 10:42am and 317m of elevation gain. After 3.44km, heartrate drops to 111bpm.

30 minutes later, we step on asphalt and arrive in a small hamlet that bifurcates the trail on to *Takahara* (a short 1km trip), or to *Chikatsuyu* for another 8.5km, our original plan. The place has toilets, seats, tables, vending machine full of sold out drinks, a [cute cat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9tvZgwJ85RSh28TG7), and pay phone available.
Lovely views of the mountains.

We feel uncertain about continuing. The forecast indicates rain and we feel the 514 meters of elevation gain was probably enough for the day. On the other hand, it's only 12:38pm, and if we can keep good pace, we will able to arrive at our next guesthouse before 5pm. The other option is taking a bus from Takahara to our next logding.

I sip my coffee, shrug and ask, "where would the fun be in that? We travelled around the planet for the challenge", and we decide to continue.

As we get back into the trail to *Chikatsuyu*, we meet another steep ascend. This time, it's not a staircase, but a flat, slope surface that make your shin muscles burn. 15 minutes in and it feels extremely tiresome. 

Being tired is fine. After all, we came here knowing we'd get exhausted, so I will skip the complains about that. The challenge is watching my mind autonomously ask how long still to go before it gets easier, how long for the pain to stop, but it's not really useful to think any of that. It's useless and complete waste of mental energy to ponder about things you can't change, or the path that has been planned a long ago. Where we are now is just a zone of discomfort and the right thing to do is to push the body forward. That focus that matters.

Another piece of bad news: my back hurts. I was expecting that, and expecting it earlier. During my prep for this walk, my back had been bothering me quite a lot. For some reason it hadn't hurt for a while, but now it does.

And this heavy backpack is not helping, for sure. This is weighing 10-20kg. I decided to bring my laptop to unload my photos and write every night, to keep my mind going during these 5 days. That is definitely making a negative difference. 

What helps me is engaging my core deliberately, like when someone's gonna punch you and you flinch. As my belly gets stiffer, I feel a relief in the middle of my back. So, overall, we're following the plan as intended, but I guess at this point, the decision is picking the less annoying annoyance.

A mile and a half into our trail, after beautiful forests and trails, we are welcomed by an incredible lake reflecting the trees and the sky.

There’s something beautiful and mysterious about this place. Pondering about how many people have walked these paths before, and all their experiences and the memories combined. Yet, here I am.

In the 11th century, retired Emperor *Go-Shirakawa* walked the Kumano Kodo thirty-four times. Emperor *Go-Toba* twenty-eight. It was while walking these trails in 1160 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori" target="_blank">*Taira no Kiyomori*</a> got word that his opponent, *Minamoto Yoshitomo*, had token the opportunity to stage a coup in Kyoto.

I have a sense of gratitude just for being able to start the trail, let alone finish it. Just to be able to dip my toes into a little bit of the history is a privilege.

Watch shows 2:57pm and we made all the way to half of the trail to *Chikatsuyu*. A total of 05h06 so far, 909 m of elevation gained and 11km.

When comparing to the beginning of the trail, the worse part was later on. Contrary to what the *Tanabe* prefecture's website says, that *Takijiri→Takahara* is harder than *Takahara→Chikatsuyu*, I found the opposite to be true! Well, I could also attribute that to the weight, energy and aggregated tiredness, which feels like has compounded a lot.

My left knee starts hurting. I end up using my hips for walking than the knees. It’s lots of ups and downs, and in some places we have to almost use our hands to climb without falling. It just keeps going on and on and on.

My back is in a lot of pain now, but according to my calculations, we're two-thirds towards the end of today's trail, so now it should be only a descend all the way to Chikatsuyu, which should make our lives easier.

However, there is this annoying pain two inches below my knee when we descend. It's insistent and annoying. But it's fine, I understand, it's probably some weak muscle I ignored in the gym. A muscle that is never used until you jump into millennial hike, like the *Kumano Kodo*.

We suddenly spot *Chikatsuyu* in the horizon, in between the trees, and enter the village by what looks like a backdoor, coming in from the mountains.

We arrive at around 5:40pm, 20 minutes before the only market around closes. We buy instant noodles for dinner along with some deserts, and eggs and bread for breakfast the next morning.

## Day 2: Hosshinmon-oji to Hongu
￼
Transcript: we wake up in Chikatsuyu and get ready to depart. We take one last stroll in this beauty to buy coffee before we jump on a bus to get to Hoshimon-oji.

And from there, walk down to Hongu.

A standard strategy is walking from here to Hongu, but it's not as beautiful of a trail.

From Hosshinmon-ji, what do we can see the Hongu Taisha as we descend the mountain.

Transcript: A big challenge with this trail is the stairs. They are not built for regular steps. They're all over the place, so you have to be mindful and careful all the time. There's this constant discomfort in the walk for a while. That's the middle of the trail, though.

The beginning of the trail, though, was very beautiful as the modern road ends up meeting the old. The asphalt meets the sand.

￼


Transcript: The trail is breath-taking, but some spots are of a beauty that forces us to stop and admire.

We have to stop and let the shutter speed of our memory capture all the light for seconds so we can remember it later, more vividly.

It's like a film that is being revealed in my mind.. That I could try to..

---

There are passages where I will just walk, just focus on where my feet are landing. And then I will...

Just do that.

And then, at certain points, I will pause, and I will admire the beauty of what's around me.

I have seen tree roots, millenar three roots serving as a long stair up and down. I have seen stairs made of rocks. I have seen stairs where each step is different where there is a combination or a mix of roots, rocks, sand.

But the most impressive of all are these stairs that were crafted or built by the feet of the thousands and thousands of people who have,
a step at a time, helped shape this trail, the Kumano Kodo.

## Day 3: Rest day in Yunomine

Today we rest. We wake up in Hongu and spend the day Yunomine.

The morning was a little bit chaotic. We thought cafe's and restaurants would be open.

According to Google Maps, but they were closed. So we ended up finding a small grocery store and making our own breakfast real quick before check out.

***

On the way to.. On the way to you Yunomine, we were dropped off 30 minutes away from the onsen and walked up all the way to the onsen area, the main touristic area, where we spent maybe 5 hours total.

It was really hot. Excruciatingly hot, to the point that I had to stop a few times, despite the short walk. Also my back was hurting.

We were surprised that the town was empty.

So, we just wandered around and bought a ticket to the Tsuboyu onsen and spent good time in there. Despite the hot water, inside of the hut, it wasn't that hot.

20 minutes or so in the hot water, 25 minutes inside the hot water followed by a cold water meant that once we got out, we were feeliing fresh, despite the temperature. The skin felt cold, especially with the small towel around our neck, still slightly soaked and humid.

We boiled eggs. Had lunch. And sat down at a bustop bench.

A wooden bench.

<img src="day-3/bus-stop.png" />

To appreciate the scene, we play a little game: name 5 things we see. Four things we hear. Three things we feel. Two things we smell. One taste.

I recorded some audio here, just, uh...

Living in the present.

But now that I am here for a while, my mind has calmed down.

And I'm just enjoying the.. The wind blowing through my skin.

I might get an ice cream.

We are now waiting for the bus to take us to Kawayu.



# Day 4: Kogumotori-oji

Problems:

- Koguchi has no logding
- Knee pain
- Trail is hard, 4 out of 5.

Transcript: So this is day four, the hardest day.

We started a day with bad news. My right knee. It is hurting, aching. There's a pain. But it's not a lot. It's 2 out of 10. Score. It's enough to make us ponder what to do.

Should we keep walking? Should we catch a bus to Shingu and not doing any trail today? Should we just walk on a flat surface, stay in the a village, or maybe do a boat tour? The risk is, you know, putting too much stress on the knee and getting stuck in the middle of nowhere.

In the middle of the jungle.

Okay, and then what?

This is 13 kilometers, at the end of the day. Even though there are other pilgrims on these trails, it's not that common.

If you get injured, can you just imagine the inconvenience of waiting for someone else to return? Or maybe you just try to go walking despite the pain? Slowly, but then you get, in the middle of, in the village, gonna be the middle of nowhere.

At midnight, no lights. Nowhere to sleep. Then maybe I have my first ever homeless simulation. In my life.

I mean, it wouldn't be the end of the world, but it's definitely not something I want to experience today.

### Shipping weight

So after thinking about alternatives for a while, after some discussion, we have this idea of shipping whatever is left to a later hotel. All we need is a cardboard box. We're gonna try to see if the hotel's owner has cardboard box.

So we can ship.. Parts of our.. Weight, to the next, we'll tell.

For example, I'm carrying my laptop, which, despite being a very light one, it's, it's a kilo kilo and a half.

Or some stuff.. Like a self stick.

Or a stabilizer stick.

Put a camera.

And there's some minor stuff.

Like moisturizer or.. Eye drops.

I, um...

So we.. We talk to the owner.

He's able to find a box in the trash.

We were able to clean it up.

Sufficiently enough.

And then we put our stuff in it, we tape, and there he goes to Kyoto.

We feel a little bit more optimistic. And decide to.. To compromise, when I go.. Five kilometers into this trail.

To Hakon, Jura.

The highest point.

The highest point in this in the Kugomotori Trail.

And then, once we get there, we're gonna analyze the time.

Are we behind?

They used on a.. On a time distribution every way.

Be set up.

Or...

Um...

Should we return?

Is it five kilometers?

It's not a half?

It's almost there, but it's the hardest part.

And if we get there ahead of time, then we're gonna make a decision to either go all the way or not.

We'll see what happens.

### Hitting our objectives

Transcript: So I have turned a lot of struggle.

We got to our checkpoint.

He can, he can, you know, top.

It was fairly hard, but we got there ahead of time, at around 10:20. We rushed.

10 20. 1020, and then we stopped for a couple minutes to take some photos.

And made the decision to...

Well, to continue to go, Gucci.

It's interesting because on the one hand, we've been...

Well, we've been trying to be as large as possible in our decisions.

But then, at some point, on the trail, we thought, yeah, I just wouldn't feel good returning.

And so we just decided to go.

It's, after all, is said, and, um, the decision was.. Based on gut.. Based on feeling, and that's fine.

### Ending the trail

Transcript: So, we ended up handing the trail.

To our surprise.

Three hours and 15 minutes.

You're right.

At the end of the trail it.. 12, 05 or so, 12, 10.

12, 10.

And we.. Are now heading to Kuguchi to.. See what's up there.

We.. We're gonna have lunch.

We are very tired.

My knee, my right knee, when I stop straight, my.. Right knee starts shaking, front time back, front time back, from time back.

Let's see.

Five backs, 30.

Everything hurts.

A little while, I wonder, under one hand, we are optimistic.

We were surprised.

We are positive.

Uh...

Despite all the pessimism at the beginning, we made the first trail.

However, do I have the energy to do the second trail?

The orgumotori?

Oji?

To...

All the way tonight, she sent...

Hell, no.

I am.. Destroyed.

Boy, they destroyed it.

# Day 5





# "Tomorrow" / Conclusion

<span class="asterisk">***</span>

吉野山<br />
こぞのしをりの<br />
道かへて<br />

Mount Yoshino<br />
I’ll leave last year’s marked path,<br />
take a different way,<br />
and search for blossoms<br />
in places I’ve not yet seen.<br />

After finishing the Kumano, Saigyō’s vow to change the road lands hard. It’s an invitation to honor what you just walked, but pivot and keep seeking “blossoms”, insight, and wonder on new paths. It’s a nudge to carry the pilgrimage mindset onward into whatever comes next.

That’s what I’ll do.
