For thousands of years, the Kumano Kodo trails in Japan have guided pilgrims toward sacred temples and connected walkers in search of meaning, or just adventure. While walking those paths for five days in search of the latter, I may have stumbled upon a little of the former.

The idea of a total reset had been circling my mind for some time. A need to disconnect from routine, to tune out of the noise, and reconnect with myself and my creative thoughts. The Kumano Kodo seemed like the perfect backdrop for that experiment. Now, after tracing its ancient routes, I feel renewed.

The absense of Switzerland's turquoise lakes or the dramatic Alps of France meant that the landscape wouldn't steal the spotlight, it would walk beside me instead, a quiet companion. Yet, by the final day, all I wanted was to start again. I had underestimated the beauty hidden in those soft, green mountains.

From the start, I knew this would have to be a distraction-free walk. Even when the ideas was still forming, it was clear that I wanted full immersion: no social media, no podcasts, no music. Just the here and the now. No autopilot, only awareness.

## Day 1: Takijiri-oji to Chikatsuyu

It's 9am, September 29. My wife and I are in *Takijiri-oji* (滝尻王子), where our walk begins, after our <a href="https://www.balsamicojam-nankiwakayama.com/kumano-winery-guest-house" target="winery-airbnb">Airbnb host</a> gave us a ride in a mini-van. The small hamlet looks neat but unsurprising, like the several others we saw on the road. The mountains and the forests, though, are imponent and seemingly impenetrable.

"Is one of *these* the one we'll climb?", is one question that pops in my mind. At first glance, they look quite steep. The night before, a guest who walked from *Tajikiri-oji* to *Takahara* invested time in an attempt to persuade us to skip it. I sipped wine and shrugged, "where would the fun be in that? I travelled around the planet for this".

Around the planet, indeed. Residing in Brazil, we planned a stopover in the US to dillute the hardship. The journey from Denver until arrival in Tanabe the night before was pure chaos, a tight schedule with endless potential points of failure. More on that later, however, because my eyes must now focus on these mountains.

The walk starts off like climbing a literal staircase, except the steps are twice the height of a regular one. At first glance, it looks quite a beautiful scenery, "lots of photography opportunities", you think. You don't commonly see rocky stairs intertwined with tree roots like these anywhere.

But then the real work starts. After a hundred, two meters of elevation, my body protests loudly, "what the hell are you doing, Alex?". "I didn't even have the time to wake up yet", it complains. The initial climb is sudden, dramatic and slow, and it rains lightly, with only a few drops overcome the trees protection.

After a while, the stairs morph into into made of marble-sized little rocks. Every step is a meticulous task of positioning the foot properly, as if my ankles are dancing. The physical intensity is only matched by the mental challenge of choosing where to thread among the infinity of roots.

After a brutal initial ascend, we reach a flat section where we can accelerate and keep a better pace. The watch displays 10:42am and 317m of elevation gain. After 3.44km, heartrate drops to 111bpm.

Half an hour later, we step on asphalt and arrive in a small hamlet that bifurcates the trail on to *Takahara* (a short 1km trip), or to *Chikatsuyu* for another 8.5km, our original plan. The place has toilets, seats, tables, vending machine full of sold out drinks, a [cute cat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9tvZgwJ85RSh28TG7), and pay phone available.
Lovely views of the mountains.

￼<img src="/images/posts/2025-10-03-five-days-on-the-kumano-kodo/day1/L1001343.JPG" />

We feel uncertain about continuing. The forecast indicates rain and we feel the 514 meters of elevation gain was probably enough for the day. On the other hand, it's only 12:38pm, and if we can keep good pace, we will able to arrive at our next guesthouse before 5pm. The other option is taking a bus from Takahara to our next logding.

I sip my coffee shrug, "where would the fun be in that? We travelled around the planet for the challenge", and we decide to continue.

<div class="asterisks">***</div>

As we get back into the trail to *Chikatsuyu*, we meet another steep ascend. This time, it's not a staircase, but a flat, slope surface that make your shin muscles burn. 15 minutes in and it feels extremely tiresome.

Being tired is fine. After all, we came here knowing we'd get exhausted, so I will skip the complaints about that. The challenge is watching my mind autonomously asking how long still to go before it gets easier, or how long for the pain to stop. That's not really useful thought, though. It's a waste of mental energy to ponder about things you can't change, or the path that has been planned a long ago. Where we are now is just a zone of discomfort and the right thing to do is to push the body forward. That focus that matters.

<div class="asterisk">***</div>

A layer of complexity (and exhaustion) added to this walk was how hectic our arrival in Japan was after a 10-hour sleepless flight. We had roughly 24 hours to arrive, travel 10h, sleep, pack, buy gear, figure out where to get bear spray. Please don't even get me started on the bear spray adventure. Then, in Tanabe the evening before the walk, we got a taxi driver that ignored our instructions and drove us elsewhere, causing all sorts of stress and we got to our Airbnb late. I mean, in the end everything worked out neatly, but it also felt like we were parachuting into the trail, like being dropped in the middle of a combat zone. It took us a while of walking to finally "cooldown" and get into the mental flow we came here for.

To add to the fun, my back hurts. It's fine, and I was expecting that, expecting it earlier. During my prep for this walk, my back had been bothering me quite a lot. For some reason it hadn't hurt for a while, but now it does.

And this heavy backpack is not helping, for sure. This is weighing 10-20kg. I decided to bring my laptop to unload my photos and write every night, to keep my mind going during these 5 days. That is definitely making a negative difference.

What helps me is engaging my core deliberately, like when someone's gonna punch you and you flinch. As my belly gets stiffer, I feel a relief in the middle of my back. So, overall, we're following the plan as intended, but I guess at this point, the decision is picking the less annoying annoyance.

A mile and a half into our trail, after beautiful forests and trails, we are welcomed by an incredible lake reflecting the trees and the sky.

There’s something beautiful and mysterious about this place. Pondering about how many people have walked these paths before, and all their experiences and the memories combined. Yet, here I am.

In the 11th century, retired Emperor *Go-Shirakawa* walked the Kumano Kodo thirty-four times. Emperor *Go-Toba* twenty-eight. It was while walking these trails in 1160 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori" target="_blank">*Taira no Kiyomori*</a> got word that his opponent, *Minamoto Yoshitomo*, had token the opportunity to stage a coup in Kyoto.

I have a sense of gratitude just for being able to start the trail, let alone finish it. Just to be able to dip my toes into a little bit of the history is a privilege.

The wrist watch shows 2:57pm and we made all the way to half of the trail to *Chikatsuyu*. A total of 05h06 so far, 909 m of elevation gained and 11km.

When comparing to the beginning of the trail, the worse part was later on. Contrary to what the *Tanabe* prefecture's website says, that *Takijiri→Takahara* is harder than *Takahara→Chikatsuyu*, I found the opposite to be true! Well, I could also attribute that to the weight, energy and aggregated tiredness, which feels like has compounded a lot.

My left knee starts hurting. I end up using my hips for walking than the knees. It’s lots of ups and downs, and in some places we have to almost use our hands to climb without falling. It just keeps going on and on and on.

My back is in a lot of pain now, but according to my calculations, we're two-thirds towards the end of today's trail, so now it should be only a descend all the way to Chikatsuyu, which should make our lives easier.

However, there is this annoying pain two inches below my knee when we descend. It's insistent and annoying. But it's fine, I understand, it's probably some weak muscle I ignored in the gym. A muscle that is never used until you jump into millennial hike, like the *Kumano Kodo*.

We suddenly spot *Chikatsuyu* on the horizon, in between the trees, and enter the village by what looks like a backdoor, coming in from the mountains.

We arrive at around 5:40pm, 20 minutes before the only market around closes. We buy instant noodles for dinner along with some deserts, and eggs and bread for breakfast the next morning.

## Day 2: Hosshinmon-oji to Hongu

We wake up in *Chikatsuyu*. This morning is the first proper morning in four days. A morning where we can sit down and chill, without the burning sensation of acceleration to get somewhere. The last night before our flight from Denver to Tokyo, I could barely sleep 2-3 hours, thinking non-stop about the trip, only to get up at 5:30 to head to the airport.

So, yes, we take our time. We take the deepest and longest inhale you can imagine. We stroll the village under blue skies to buy coffee, right before we jump on a bus to get to *Hosshinmon-oji*.

<figcaption>Slow stroll through Chikatsuyu</figcaption>
</figure>

The plan: walk down to *Hongu*. Most people just walk from here to *Hongu*, but, supposedly, the views as you descend from *Hosshinmon-oji* are nicer than starting in *Chikatsuyu*, so we will make that bet. We'll hop on a bus to get to the trail. Ultimately, the destination is the same.

<div class="asterisk">***</div>

*"What's going on here?"* I wonder, confused as I get on the bus. There's like what appears to be two hundred people inside. It feels chaotic and messy, and a thousand eyes are gazing at us. I sigh. *"I can't believe we're standing for a whole hour with these heavy bags!"*.

As we look around and try to figure out where to stay, humbly peeking over backrests in search of spots, I notice people are sitting on their luggages in the aisle, something I'd never seen before. It looks totally unsafe, but I won't judge.

A woman points at me and to the aisle, as if saying, *"You, stay there!"* I get even more confused. But, as I scan the corridor, I don't see any suitcase or luggage wheel. Wait a second! This bus has a fifth seat that folds from beside another seat, fitting five people per row! Japan really is the country of the future.

We walk on asphalt for 10 minutes before getting on to serious business. The trail is stunning. The modern road meets the old. Then asphalt and hamlets again, a symbiosis of community and nature.

The trail is breathtaking, and some spots seem to whisper, "Please, stop and admire me". We oblige.

We slow down, gazing at the quaint hamlets, letting our eyes absorb the light like a sensor during a long exposure, etching memories onto a film of our minds. We want to remember this moment later, as vividly as possible.

The middle of today's trail gets challenging, like a game of Tetris, except it's your feet trying to fit the right spots. The staircases aren't built for regular steps. They're all over the place. There's a sense of continuous alertness and mild discomfort while walking. "The ankles need to be preserved at all costs", I repeat as mantra.

There are passages where my whole mental energy is focusing on where my feet are landing. Just that and nothing else. And then, at certain points, I pause and admire the beauty of what's around me.

I have seen millenar three roots serving as a long stair up and down. I have seen stairs made of rocks naturally. I have seen stairs with uneven steps. I have seen them all mixed, roots, rocks, sand.

The most impressive, however, are the ones that were crafted by the feet of the thousands and thousands of people who have,
a step at a time, helped shape this trail, the Kumano Kodo.

In between the woods, we spot what appears to be the outskirts of *Hongu*. Our expectation to see the tall torii gate grows exponentially.

We arrive at the Hongu Taisha area, respectfully appreciating the view of the shrine, and taking some time to admire banners, the architecture, the gold and silver.

On our way we continue, down the stairs that will lead to the Hongu's streets, and the torii gate.

<div class="asterisk"><a name="portal">***</a></div> 

After months of planning and preparation, we arrive at the imponent *Oyunohara* (大斎原) *torii* gate, the point around which our journey orbits.

I feel like a tiny ant standing in front of this *torii* gate. It has great personal significance. I'll explain why.

Have you ever noticed how portals are everywhere in our culture? In *Alice in Wonderland*, the main character needs to go through a tiny portal to get to the *other side of her reality*. In *Narnia*, a hidden portal inside a wardrobe leads the characters to another world. In *The Matrix*, Neo passes a mental portal to wake up to the *real* world.

Some portals are conceptual, like event checkpoints. When *Einstein* discovered *Relativity*, the human race went through a portal after which life wouldn't ever be the same.  *Penicilin*, vaccines, combustion engines, the printing press.

Portals are hard to be found. When you find them, you must make an intentional decision to go through. It takes effort. Once you do, your life is changed forever, and you can't fathom returning through it to your old reality. It'd be like death. Often times, you will come back to try and tell others where the portal is, but they downplay it, or laugh at you. You might try to tell them how it is like beyond the portal, the colors, the magnificence, but they won't understand because they haven't seen it for themselves.

In 2011, I crossed a portal. Living in a 5,000 inhabitants rural village in south of Brazil and with a 250Kbps bare internet connection, somehow I managed to get a disproportionally high-paying job in the US. On the other side of this portal, my life changed forever. I learned new ways of thinking, how to be productive, successful examples that challenged my education thus far, and how value is generated. For years, however, people thought I was a lunatic. You know, small town chatter. I tried to help others come through the portal, but they either couldn't find it, weren't willing to make the hard decision, or found it impossible.

Shinto *torii* gates captivate me because they represent a transition from mundane to a new reality, like the portals above. They are a celebration of the many portals distributed throughout space and time, yet hard to be found. They reward those who make the required decision to go through them, with a willingness to leave the past behind.

Being here has a special meaning this evening. This *torii* represents our quest for hidden portals. Quite possibly, having done this pilgrimage could mean I crossed another portal and my life will never be the same.

We sleep tonight in an Airbnb in *Hongu*.

## Rest day in Yunomine

Today we'll head over to *Yunomine*, a small hot springs village. Tsuboyu is renowed as Japan's oldest onsen and a UNESCO World Heritage site. If things go according to plan, we'll chill, soak in hot water, and sit on a bench until our butts go numb. We'll watch birds flying, kids playing and trees dancing.

We wake up to a chaotic morning, rushed and on empty stomachs. Google Maps had told us cafés and restaurants would be open today, but guess what, they were closed. Walking through streets on an empty stomach to find closed doors isn't fun. Fortunately, we stumble upon a small grocery store and throw together the quickest breakfast before check-out.

The mini-bus drops us 30 minutes away from *Yunomine* and we walk uphill. It hot and humid. No, it's actually excruciatingly hot, and the lack of shades on the road we're walking makes us stop a few times to cool down our body. Despite the short walk, my back hurts.

Who said this was going to be a rest day?

We find an empty village when we arrive. Not a single soul, such a good surprise. We wander around without our backpacks and buy tickets to *Tsuboyu*.

I'm mildly reluctant to dip into almost-boiling water, given how hot it is, but finishing with cold water leaves a lasting freshness. Our skin stays cold for a good hour or two afterwards. A small, soaked towel wrapped strategically around my neck makes me feel like a capybara ease.


[TODO]
We boiled eggs. Had lunch.


And sat down at a bustop bench.

A wooden bench.

<img src="day-3/bus-stop.png" />

To appreciate the scene, we play a little game: name 5 things we see. Four things we hear. Three things we feel. Two things we smell. One taste.

I recorded some audio here, just, uh...

Living in the present.

But now that I am here for a while, my mind has calmed down.

And I'm just enjoying the.. The wind blowing through my skin.

I might get an ice cream.

We are now waiting for the bus to take us to Kawayu.



# Day 4: Kogumotori-oji

Problems:

- Koguchi has no logding
- Knee pain
- Trail is hard, 4 out of 5.

Transcript: So this is day four, the hardest day.

We started a day with bad news. My right knee. It is hurting, aching. There's a pain. But it's not a lot. It's 2 out of 10. Score. It's enough to make us ponder what to do.

Should we keep walking? Should we catch a bus to Shingu and not doing any trail today? Should we just walk on a flat surface, stay in the a village, or maybe do a boat tour? The risk is, you know, putting too much stress on the knee and getting stuck in the middle of nowhere.

In the middle of the jungle.

Okay, and then what?

This is 13 kilometers, at the end of the day. Even though there are other pilgrims on these trails, it's not that common.

If you get injured, can you just imagine the inconvenience of waiting for someone else to return? Or maybe you just try to go walking despite the pain? Slowly, but then you get, in the middle of, in the village, gonna be the middle of nowhere.

At midnight, no lights. Nowhere to sleep. Then maybe I have my first ever homeless simulation. In my life.

I mean, it wouldn't be the end of the world, but it's definitely not something I want to experience today.

So after thinking about alternatives for a while, after some discussion, we have this idea of shipping whatever is left to a later hotel. All we need is a cardboard box. We're gonna try to see if the hotel's owner has cardboard box.

So we can ship.. Parts of our.. Weight, to the next, we'll tell.

For example, I'm carrying my laptop, which, despite being a very light one, it's, it's a kilo kilo and a half.

Or some stuff.. Like a self stick.

Or a stabilizer stick.

Put a camera.

And there's some minor stuff.

Like moisturizer or.. Eye drops.

I, um...

So we.. We talk to the owner.

He's able to find a box in the trash.

We were able to clean it up.

Sufficiently enough.

And then we put our stuff in it, we tape, and there he goes to Kyoto.

We feel a little bit more optimistic. And decide to.. To compromise, when I go.. Five kilometers into this trail.

To Hakon, Jura.

The highest point.

The highest point in this in the Kugomotori Trail.

And then, once we get there, we're gonna analyze the time.

Are we behind?

They used on a.. On a time distribution every way.

Be set up.

Or...

Um...

Should we return?

Is it five kilometers?

It's not a half?

It's almost there, but it's the hardest part.

And if we get there ahead of time, then we're gonna make a decision to either go all the way or not.

We'll see what happens.

### Hitting our objectives

Transcript: So I have turned a lot of struggle.

We got to our checkpoint.

He can, he can, you know, top.

It was fairly hard, but we got there ahead of time, at around 10:20. We rushed.

10 20. 1020, and then we stopped for a couple minutes to take some photos.

And made the decision to...

Well, to continue to go, Gucci.

It's interesting because on the one hand, we've been...

Well, we've been trying to be as large as possible in our decisions.

But then, at some point, on the trail, we thought, yeah, I just wouldn't feel good returning.

And so we just decided to go.

It's, after all, is said, and, um, the decision was.. Based on gut.. Based on feeling, and that's fine.

### Ending the trail

Transcript: So, we ended up handing the trail.

To our surprise.

Three hours and 15 minutes.

You're right.

At the end of the trail it.. 12, 05 or so, 12, 10.

12, 10.

And we.. Are now heading to Kuguchi to.. See what's up there.

We.. We're gonna have lunch.

We are very tired.

My knee, my right knee, when I stop straight, my.. Right knee starts shaking, front time back, front time back, from time back.

Let's see.

Five backs, 30.

Everything hurts.

A little while, I wonder, under one hand, we are optimistic.

We were surprised.

We are positive.

Uh...

Despite all the pessimism at the beginning, we made the first trail.

However, do I have the energy to do the second trail?

The orgumotori?

Oji?

To...

All the way tonight, she sent...

Hell, no.

I am.. Destroyed.

Boy, they destroyed it.

吉野山<br />
こぞのしをりの<br />
道かへて<br />
まだ見ぬかたの<br />
花をたづねん

Mount Yoshino<br />
I’ll leave last year’s marked path,<br />
take a different way,<br />
and search for blossoms<br />
in places I’ve not yet seen.<br />

After finishing the Kumano, Saigyō’s vow to change the road lands hard. It’s an invitation to honor what you just walked, but pivot and keep seeking “blossoms”, insight, and wonder on new paths. It’s a nudge to carry the pilgrimage mindset onward into whatever comes next.

That’s what I’ll do.
