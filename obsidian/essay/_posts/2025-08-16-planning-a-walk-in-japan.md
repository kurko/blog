In six months or so, I'll walk the Kumano Kodo in Japan. The idea of doing a total reset had been popping into my mind for a while, a certain attraction to disconnecting from habits and the world to reconnect with myself. A quiet, five-day journey through mountain passes and primitive, lush forests looks like the perfect setting for that.

The Kumano Kodo trails are special. For thousands of years, they led pilgrims to majestic temples in Hongu, Shingu and Nachi, connecting all walkers of life in search of meaning, salvation, or just adventure. The absense of Switzerland-like turquoise lakes and Italian-looking alps means that the region doesn't impose itself as the movie's main character, but as a pleasant companion for the journey.

My humble walk from guesthouse to guesthouse is meant to be distraction-free. No social media, podcasts, music, just the here and the now. No autopilot, only being present.

Concepts

- the walk is the destination, the temples are just rewards

## A good walk

In my book, a good walk will be *boring*, *memorable*, and *pleasant*. Boredom benefits our brains by opening space for inward reflection and creativity. External impulses, on the other hand, steals our focus. In a world of infinite stimulation, boredom heals. Thoughts get shaken like a tree, and the bad apples fall to the ground.

Nearing fourty, you bet it has to be goddamm memorable. Trails are everywhere, but they don't come with flights to the other side of the planet, trains sliding by at 200-miles-per-hour, and milenial history. "I walked for days in Japan" carries its own weight to anyone who hears it, regardless of their origins. It absolutely does for me.

Making it pleasant means primary memories will be about reconnection, reflections, mindfulness. The adventure needs challenges to be fun and rewarding. However, a monumental struggle through mood, torrential rain or scorching sun would tip the scale in the opposite direction. I don't want to remember it being 75% good, the rest being burden and annoying problems. I mean, I don't expect it will be perfect, but I'll do what I can to keep it a great experience.

Five-to-six days feels like the absolute sweet spot. A one-day walk doesn't carve out enough memories. It doesn't get boring enough. A 10-day walk, on the other hand, advances the boredom and pain. Two days, three, none look like it'd leave a deep enough mark. Five days, though, that's the perfect shape for this walk's objectives.

## The shape of the walk

To be in the present, no modern distractions are allowed. No mobile phone, no social media, no podcasts or music transporting us elsewhere. Taking pictures is a must (memorable, remember?), but even that could be distracting, so I'll be intentional and keep the shutter movements limited to certain windows of time.

One rule is that no more than 15 miles (~20 km) will be walked per day. I need to keep in mind that I'm an amateur that will be carrying a 15-20 pounds backpack. Guesthouses will be waiting before dawn everyday. I won't feel bad if I have to take a bus to respect my limits. 

A rest day will wait for me on Day 3. That day will serve for reflection about the previous day, while my sore legs recover for the final push. A great candidate is Yunomine, the oldest *onsen* in the world. That depends on what trail will be chosen.

Overall, we must reach our destination everyday by 4pm. Guesthouses prepare baths by 3:30-4pm, and dinner is served at 6pm. Arriving later will make leave hosts quite annoyed and unhappy.

The Kumano Kodo is a UNESCO heritage pilgrimage trail, and you can collect stamps along the way. Honestly? I don't care as much about that. It's a nice-to-have, sure, but I won't care if I don't get it, especially if it's for a better trail.

## What would be the ideal trail?
<span class="subtitle"> ❈ 117 days to the walk</span>

The decision to walk the Kumano Kodo was made a long ago, but the indecision lingers about which route. There are many, all coming from different regions but leading to the same temples.

The ones that stand out are the *Iseji*, a 130 mile (~170km) journey from the city of Ise, threading through mountains and beaches, through fishermen villages by the Pacific coast; the *Nakahechi*, a more traditional hike starting from Tanabe through gorgeous forests and mountains passes; the *Kohechi*, a tougher version of the *Nakahechi*, starting or ending *Koyasan* to the north; or the *Nakasendo*, a 350 miles (~500 km) traditional road people used to travel between Tokyo and Kyoto (not Kumano Kodo, though).

I spent *a lot* of time reading about these trails, you have no idea. The Nakasendo looks absolutely gorgeous, it still preserves the architecture and style from the Sengoku period, when Samurais would traverse those roads towards the capital, but my heart is inclined to Iseji and Nakahechi. The Kohechi looks ok, but I sense it'll be too painful for an amateur like me.

*Iseji* is longer and its beaches add variety to the walk. Walkers mention an awe, as you walk down from the mountains towards the ocean. *Nakahechi* is a traditional hiking trail, with more severe elevation gains, deep into the forest. It is beautiful, don't get me wrong, but it's not *as beautiful*, although its utmost historic importance.

### Planning takes a hit

Personal and business matters force me to spend a month in the United States immediately before the walk. Now, I'm planning another juggernaut of a trip, which slows down the Japanese one to a halt. There are simply too many logistic details to figure out.

Where can I exercise? Where can I practice stair climbing? For each Airbnb option, are there grocery stores at walking distance? Should I purchase hiking gear in the US, and if yes, where?

Spoiler alert: the trip will get way more complex with US in the equation.

### A new partner

This trip was supposed to be solo because my wife had an unavoidable work schedule. I had no choice, I had take vacations this year or I'd lose it.

Winds changed direction and my wife was able to free up her scheduled, so she's joining me in the walk. The overall purpose and rules still apply, but a rather gray-ish journey suddenly became colorful.

The scale tips towards Iseji. My wife has a preference for the coastal walk. The images are incredible. 

## The ground shakes
<span class="subtitle"> ❈  59 days before the walk.</span>

So, *Iseji* or *Nakahechi*? I've spent way more time than I'd like to admit choosing between the two trails. So-much-research. One such aspect is bears. My YouTube feed algorithm suggests now only topics like, "How you'd not survive a bear attack", and "The ten worst bear attacks in history". I regret having searched about that at any point.

A whole article could be written about the Japanese black bears. They are more pervasive in the north of Japan, roaming villages, foraging trash, but nonetheless present along the Kumano Kodo. Encounters are extremely rare, but my instinct of leaving no stone unturned means I've spent the last few weeks reading about the topic, triangulating sightings from local prefecture maps to calculate odds of being the lucky one to hug a bear. By my calculations, it's 4 times more likely to be bitten by a dog than encounter a bear. Unfortunately, I've already been bitten by a dog...

Out of a sudden, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggers [tsunami warnings across Japan and the US](https://archive.is/8KcTE), and the decision about Iseji sort of self-resolves. It's a road on the coast!

I mean, tsunamis are rare and even if they occur, sirens would howl hours before any catastrophy. We'd just walk to high ground. However, would I want to walk while my brain is in constant alert about a potential wave washing us off? I don't think so, despite how gorgeous *Iseji* is. More or less at the same time, I learned that bear sightings are way more common along the *Iseji* road too (probably because it's a longer road, I suspect), in relation to the *Nakahechi*.

In any case, it feels way, way less stressful to go with the *Nakahechi* and leave the *Iseji* for another time.

## Nakahechi

I ponder about different trails, how they connect, how to limit a day's total distance walked, where to grab food, potential guesthouses, and more or less settle on starting in Takigiri. The truth is that I spent a long time considering a simple route, like starting in Takahara, but what fun would that be?

The overall goal is reaching the three religious places, Hongu Taisha, Shingu temple, and Nachi-san. The itinerary in my mind looks a bit like this:

- **Day 1:** take a bus to Takijiri, and from there walk to Takahara (~3.7 km, 1.5–2.5 h; difficulty 2.5 / 5), then to Gyuba-dōji-guchi (~8 km, ~3 h; difficulty 3 / 5), and arrive in Chikatsuyu for the day (~1.3 km, 30 min; score 1).
- **Day 2, arriving in Hongu:** take the bus to Hosshinmon-oji, and walk to Hongu (~7.5 km, 2–3 h). Why take a bus?, you might ask. Well, the views as you walk down the Hosshinmon-oji are way more beautiful, and the distance is more or less the same. There's a nice spot to take pictures of the Hongu Taisha as you descend the mountains.
- **Day 3:** rest day. Uncertain where to go, but Yunomine is the best candidate. It's the oldest onsen in the world. People travel the world to bath in these waters, and it's only 3-4km from Hongu.
- **Day 4, arriving in Shingu:** here, we hike the Kogumotori-goe, the longest and hardest day, arriving in Koguchi. (a note from the future: I learned later that Koguchi doesn't have logding anymore, so the plan is to get there before 5pm, which is the last bus to Shingu. Somewhat... dangerous?)
- **Day 5, Nachisan:** we take a bus from Shingu and climb the famous Daimon-zaka stone stairs to Nachi Taisha and falls. Later, we take a train out back to civilization.

## T-44 days to hike

It feels like an eternity, the wait until we put our foot on the trail. Despite the ample time, some of these villages have a handful of places to sleep, and they book fast.

<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/chatgpt-google-maps-ios.png" class="small" />

Koguchi seem to have one available place to stay (although if you walk into further trails, there are more options, but after a long day, that's not going to be great). You'll see that two days later, I learn that Koguchi doesn't have any lodging available anymore.

<span class="dinkus">***</span>

I'm far from the ideal physical conditioning. I live in a very flat area, so you basically have long walks to gyms for training.

When walking, it takes about 20 minutes for my thoughts to start getting gradually more constrained until they almost disappear, like a meditation session. I'm more focused on whatever is important, whereas in the beginning, my thoughts are all over the place.

During practice, I also realize that my back isn't in great shape. I believe it's due to posture, so I consciously hold my core stiff and the pain decreases. One pain relif, another starts: my left heel is starting to ache, like a tiny knife is pushing up. The back pain returns, now closer to my hips.

<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/t-44-training-shadow.jpeg" alt="" class="">

After 9 km, my back pain score is 5 out of 10. It's not terrible, but just enough for me to remember every second that my back exists. I also didn't have lunch and now it's 3:14 PM so I had to have a banana. Coincidentally or not I feel like this was the most delicious banana I ever had.

I finish the training after 10 km. Two hours, an annoying back pain, and a knife in my shoe.

**Logding:** I get a scary message by Craig Mod. I completely underestimated the scarcity of places to stay along the Nakahechi.

<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/t-44-cmod-on-late-logding-booking.png" alt="" class="small">

The Japanese reservation system is terrible. Using a Japanese website feels like time travelling to the 1991. The [Tanabe prefecture website](https://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/2024/03/13/12612/), which intermediates reservations with the various village inns, doesn't work before 9am Japan time.

> The KUMANO TRAVEL Community Reservation Site is only open to receive new requests during set operational times: Daily 9:00 to 17:00 (Japan Standard Time).

Yeah, they took the physical world and replicated online. Well, I'm thankful that at least I wasn't required to send them a fax.

For the next 2 days, I aggressively research and book guesthouses / lodging. What a relief. I learned everyone's reservations start six months earlier, so I was pretty lucky to have found some options. None are great, though.

# Day zero

One proud 
mas um lugar eu to orgulhoso de ter conseguido pegar: no dia zero pré-caminhada, vamos ficar num casébrio dum chef que é indicado Michelin (sem estrela), com fazenda própria. depois das infindáveis 8-9h de trem, só tem como chegar lá (e ir embora) de taxi.

**T-40 days:** I get a detailed message from the Kawayu's guesthouse with everything they serve or don't. Unlucky me, dinners aren't served on Wednesdays.

## Elevation Reckoning
<span class="subtitle">
Realizing my walk had +1,000m / 3,600 ft of climb. 41 days to go, and I completely underestimated this walk.
</span>

I sip a cup of tea on a Wednesday, 9pm. Watching random thoughts run free in my mind, some walk-related, some are work-related, I recall how untrustworthy *Google Maps* is for plotting trails, and wonder how *Apple Maps* is doing on that front. A recent announcement promised hiking trails with higher precision.

<figure>
<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/t-37-0-shock-maps.jpeg" />
<figcaption>Apple Maps displays 3,608ft elevation</figcaption>
</figure>

"What?", I gasp. "A kilometer?", I incredulously stare at my screen for a few seconds while my head spins around. "That can't be right, *riiiight*!? This is Apple's new software, maybe it's a bug.

I suddenly feel dumb for not checking that kind of very-critical-detail before. I mean, I'm flying to the opposite side the planet, watched dozens of videos, checked routes, bus lines and schedules over and over, but no, I skipped one of the most important parts.

I'm already at arms-length into this hike, lodging is booked, I can't give up. I won't give up. So I turn to Claude to get more details.

> Claude: Looking at the Kumano Kodo trail data, from Takijiri to Chikatsuyu involves approximately 3,313 ft of elevation gain over the ~14km distance.
>
> You're looking at about 337 flights worth of elevation gai...

"337 flights of stairs?", I gasp again. That's... (counting on my fingers) climbing my apartment building 24 FREACKING TIMES. I'm faced by a monster bigger than me, a hill too tall to be conquered by someone who hasn't ever hiked. I'm also scared anticipating how my partner will hear this disturbing piece of news.

I can't give up, but I could definitely change the plans. I pursue that idea for... 2 seconds. I let that concept flash in my mind, only to realize retreating would leave me feeling unhappy and uncapable of doing what many thousands have already done. I mean, I could start off in Takahara, but it'd be flat and easy surface from there, would I feel proud of myself? This is not an Everest hike (that one is risky by definition), it's the Kumano Kodo; it doesn't look that big of a deal. So what's the real problem? Is it really impossible to do this hike? Or am I judging the situation prematurely? Maybe I just need more information before I can make a decision.

**Research mode**

"Ok, so, I need more guidance", I tell Claude. "I have roughly 30 days, I can walk on a flat surface for 15-20km. I don't seem to have enough time build up muscle to climb 300+ flights in a single session, but during the hike, I will not need to climb 300 in a single session anyway; it's distributed over 13km."

There's no size-fits-all and Claude doesn't know me, so I need a range of numbers to understand where I am. I continue, "What are the no-go, minimum, and ideal number of stairs that I need to be able to climb in a single session to train for this hike, considering that during the hike I will stop a few times for resting, and also for lunch? Let's be realistic."

> Claude: Given your 30-day timeline and current fitness (already walking 15-20km / 9-12 miles flat), here are realistic target for single sessions:
> - No-go: Less than 60 flights continuously without major distress
> - Minimum: 100-120 flights total (can break into sets of 20-30 with 2-3 min breaks)
> - Ideal: 150-180+ flights total in a session
>
> You're right - you won't need 300+ continuous flights. The elevation is distributed over hours with natural breaks for views, photos, snacks. If you can do 150 flights in sets during training, you'll manage the hike.

I lack reference points, but 150 is a bit more reassuring than 300+. That looked impossible. This? Ugh, it's still 150 floors. I don't remember ever walking nowhere close to half that many. I remember walking up 17 floors to help out a friend during a power outage. I got up there and was sweating, but I remember feeling like I could do more in a life-or-death situation. Probably not 133 more. Not probably, certainly.

AI's can be exponentially more helpful when given details about time, place and your state of mind, so I share my schedule for maximum customization. I replace Claude with ChatGPT because it's better at cranking numbers. "*Week 1*, I'm in an apartment building with 14 flights of stairs; on *week 2*, I'm at a hotel in San Francisco (it has stairs); *weeks 3-4*, Airbnb without stairs in San Jose's Santana Row area, no idea about gyms; *week 5*, I'm attending a company offsite in Vail with access to gym; *week 6*, hike starts".

I get back a plan. The looks is surprisingly detailed, tailored to my precise needs.

> If you can string 120+ floors once a week (plus flat mileage) by mid-September, you’re realistically ready. Hitting 150+ gives peace of mind.
>
> - Week 1 — 14-floor bldg: do 168 floors (total 6 loops, up only). 84 floors in 2 sessions. Walk down via elevator to save knees. Add 5 kg day-pack on 2nd session.
> - Week 2 — SF hotel: shoot for 100-120 total in 1 session. Target ≥ 120 floors. Add 1 shorter 60-floor lunch climb.
> - Weeks 3-4 — Santana Row, no stairs: if no gym is available, find a parking-garage (Valley Fair garage has 6-7 floors). Target 120 floors week 3, 150 week 4.
> - Week 5 — Vail, hotel gym + altitude: peak session: 160-180 floors continuous. Altitude makes lungs work, so keep heart rate below 80% max, and hydrate.
> - Week 6 — on trail: You’re tapering—just easy walks. Focus on sleep & nutrition.

I stand up and ask myself, "what am I doing"?

<span class="dinkus">***</span>

My partner needs to know what's going on. "Hey", I greet, "got a minute? I have good and bad news, which one do you wanna hear first?", I ask rhetorically, proceeding almost immediatelly: "The bad news is that on Day 1, we'll need to climb 1 kilometer". I pause, and she frowns with a face of calculation. "That's equivalent to 330 floors. Our building, times 24". She gives me a blank stare for a second or two, then begins laughing uncontrollably into a fetal position. "Wait, wait", I say, "there's good news: I have a plan".

# Exercise shock
<span class="subtitle">T-37 days to hike</span>

A superpower I've had since childhood is to be able to obsess over things, sometimes to my detriment, but most times for my own benefit. When in that state, fears and distraction are bypassed, and over the years I learned to channel that. Call me a nerd, but if concentrate in certain ways on an end-goal, I can turn on a kind of robotic discipline to get there. I can't explain why it works for me, but this ability helped me in key moments, from school and studying how to fix my lactose intolerance, to building my own company and getting clients in the US.

That obsession kicked in this week in full force. Once the reality of my miscalculation settled that Wednesday night, my mind could only see a picture of the mountains around Hongu with their lush forests, the carpets of stone laid out through dense cedar and cypress forests, guiding pilgrim's walks for thousands of years. I felt that the imagination, despite far into the distance, could someday be a reality in front me.

My hatred for exercising vanished the next morning. There was no procrastination, and the concept of pain felt secondary. I suspect that's a tiny bit how people like [David Goggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goggins) feel when running endless marathons. While I'd have given up sooner when lifting weights, that day I kept pushing to the final count while the Hongu Taisha Otorii flashes blinked in my mind. The exercising process had ceased from being an end in and of itself, and became a conduit, a means to a greater end. I had never felt that towards gym.

<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/t-37-gym-leg-day.jpg" alt="Gym leg day" />

Whenever thinking about the exercising I'd need to do, that thought was overlaid with the trail image I had to walk, all its tree roots and the rocky steps.

#### How much trouble am I in?

On August 22, I head to the ground floor after a workday, carrying my 1L sling bag with a water bottle, and start the climb. The first few floors go untroubled. After the 19th floor, I start breathing heavily and I need to be proactive about the rhythm. The soreness from yesterdays's workout joins me again, as if mocking my ascent. I laugh back.

My lower glutes punch me at every step. After every loop, I head down via elevator to preserve my knees (my focus is gaining muscle, not damaging my joints). After the 47th floor, small 20-30s pauses for breathing are necessary. The fight is ending, and after 37min, I complete 89 floors.

</gallery>

Eighty-nine-floors. It might look like nothing to you, or a lot, but I had not clue what to expect. I'm both jubilant that my first session finished above the *No-Go* threshold, and worried that it's below the *Minimum*. All in all, this is August 22, not September 22, so I'll keep my judgment in suspension for another month, but it looks much more doable and less scary now.

I laydown ice bags with trembling legs for my precious glutes.

Back hurts

# The last mile
<span class="subtitle">We land in Colorado for the last week before the walk. Over the weekend we take a short walk through the Garden of the Gods.</span>

I'm optimistic we'll have a good time next week. My back still hurts after long walks with a backpack, but it's manageable. My legs are doing their job well so far, to the extent I have tested them. However, most of the training has been on flat surfaces or in the gym, so it's time to go out there and start hiking more complex surfaces.

In *Vail*, on a Tuesday afternoon, we head to the Son of the Middle Trail, a 3-hour walk uphill through a color palette of yellows and greens. It's raining and muddy, but the spirit of adventure is more intense than the annoyance. I'm not alone, so in any event there is support.

The initial climb feels... tiresome. I'm shocked at how much of a bad state my breath is, I'm gasping for air. I recall, though, that *Vail*'s altitude is 8,150 ft, and I feel less bad about it. I start to wonder, however, whether having embarked on this trail was a good idea at all.

My legs keep trucking along like soldiers on a march. After 850 ft of elevation gain over 2.5 km, though, I finally start feeling glutes. I'm fighting for air, breathing keeps getting harder and harder. 

At the 50 minutes mark and 980 ft of elevation gain (300 m), I assimilate how that much is similar to Day 1 on the Kumano Kodo, from Tajikiri to Chikatsuyu, except there it's 3x the elevation gain and 13km. Here, I barely walked 2.8km.

***

There's a kind of spiritual sensation when you are in a primitive environment like this. You face your primitive sensations, your primitive struggles to keep going when your muscles are crying out for a break, all while you are applying just the necessary mental concentration to make sure you're step on the right spots, on the right rock, on the right fallen branch, beside the mud.

It makes you appreciate the modern life, how far we've come as a society. All this mental focus through struggles was once how we kept moving through tremendous distances to grab a bucket of water for our families. The physical movement is a mental training as much as it is for the muscles.

***

After an hour or so, 3.2 km and 1120 ft of elevation, a flat section that makes my legs feel like they are resting. Movement that feels like a pause. A mere 30 seconds on level ground is enough for my muscles to smile.

My left foot starts hurting after about 70 minutes. I become more intentional about what I'm doing with it. The mindfulness means throwing my foot in the air so that the movement serves as micro-massage, leaving my leg more flexible than before. That is enough for a while, and the pain subsides until I need to start climbing again, which requires making my foot stiff to sustain my body on the ground. This dynamic of pain followed by relief, followed by pain continues for another 20-30 minutes. I guess it got more relaxed after a while?

The hike continues for another hour, no more pain, my glutes are fine, my legs are marching along and I'm just used to the walk. I get into a tunnel vision and just enjoy nature.

The walk comes to an end. I'm back at the hotel. Maybe tomorrow I'll do it all over again. Should I?
