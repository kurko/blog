In about six months or so, I'll walk the Kumano Kodo in Japan. The idea of doing a total reset had been popping into my mind for a while, a certain attraction to disconnecting from habits and the world to reconnect with myself. A quiet, five-day journey through mountain passes and primitive, lush forests looks like the perfect setting for that.

For thousands of years, the trails of the Kumano Kodo led pilgrims to the majestic temples of Hongu, Shingu and Nachi, connecting all walkers of life in search of meaning, salvation, or just adventure. The absense of Switzerland-like turquoise lakes and Italian-looking alps means that the region doesn't impose itself as the movie's main character, but is just satisfied with being a pleasant companion.

My humble walk from guesthouse to guesthouse is meant to be distraction-free. No social media, podcasts, music, just the here and the now. Autopilot is out of question, only being present.

Concepts

- the walk is the destination, the temples are just rewards

~~At 12, I heard for first time about [Ruta 40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Route_40_(Argentina)) tales and rolled my eyes. A long road with no life nor gas stations for hundreds of miles, stretching through... empty nothingness? Sounded pointless and boring, gambling on spetacular isolation.~~

~~Nearing 40, that once dismissive boy learned that movement is a rebelion statement, a push back against drift. It's an opportunity to choose new directions, to find yourself at the destination. Great, old stories from friends and colleagues always permeated that theme.~~

~~Also nearing that specific time in life where priorities and concepts need to be reassessed, I don't see anything more fitting for self-reflection than a long walk, in the Einstein-sense. His daily walks were a tool for relaxation and thought, where ideas crystallizing with every footstep. I don't quite feel that way, and this sense of missing-something makes me feel compeled to return to square one (more fitting still).~~

~~[I still feel, though Being present and moving, other tales like Martijn Doolaard’s *Two Years on a Bike*, and Craig Mod's *Kissa by Kissa*.~~

~~When I reflect on my own inertia, I'm reminded of Einstein's sacred, daily walks.~~

## What a good walk's gonna look like?
## [alternative] Boring, memorable, pleasant

A good walk is *boring*, *memorable*, and *pleasant*. Five-to-six days feels like the sweet spot for that. Boredom benefits our brains by opening space for reflection about life and our problems. We get the time for thoughts to be shaken like a tree to see what fruits resist falling to the ground.

Nearing fourty, you bet it has to be goddamm memorable. Some local trails are great, but they wouldn't come with flights to the other side of the planet, trains sliding by at 200-miles-per-hour, milenial history. "I walked for days in Japan" carries its own weight to anyone who hears it, not matter their origins. It absolutely does for me.

Making it pleasant means primary memories will be about reconnection, reflections, mindfulness. Some bits of challenge is part of the adventure, it makes it fun and rewarding. A monumental struggle through mood, torrential rain or scorching sun is xxx, at least not this time. I don't want to remember it being 75% good, the rest being burden and annoying problems. I mean, I don't expect it will be perfect, but I'll do what I can to keep it 

Five-or-six days feels like the sweet spot. A one day walk doesn't carve enough memories, while a 10-day walk feels boring and painful. Two days, three, none look like it'd leave a deep enough mark.

## What a good walk's gonna look like?

**Constraints:**

- We only have 5-6 days. The rest we want to enjoy resting and vacationing.
- It’s fine to have rest days. In fact, day 3 we want it to be a rest day, and we want it to be in the Yunomine town.
- We thought about starting somewhere in Takijiri or Takahara, then to the 3 temples Hongu taisha, Shingu and Nachi. We will take buses for Nachi, we're not making the hardest climbs.
- We are amateurs, we can’t walk more than 20km in a single day. I will be carrying an Aer Pro Pack 24L, my wife will have a hip strap backpack. We are not optimizing for walking everyday. I want to have 4 days of walk, but it doesn’t need to be the whole day.
- The objective is walking, being in the present, not mobile phone, no podcasts, no music, just trying to feel the flow.
- The stamps aren’t a must-have.
- Limited internet
- No media, podcast, music: no autopilot. I should be in the moment at all times.
- We want to enjoy nature’s beauties along the way.

Inns:

- Ideal to reach by 4pm. Bath is ready by 3:30-4pm, and dinner served at 6pm. Arriving at 7pm will make hosts unhappy.

## 117 days to walk

I make the decision to walk the Kumano Kodo. I'm not sure which route, or where 

- Ise

## T-44 days to hike

Feels like an eternity until we put our foot on the trail, but some of these villages have a handful of places to sleep, and they book fast.

Koguchi has one available place to stay (although if you walk into further trails, there are more options, but after a long day, that's not going to be great).

**Training:** I'm far from ideal conditioning. All I have is flat surface around my house.

<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/t-44-training-shadow.jpeg" alt="" class="">

At the 20 minutes mark, my thoughts getting narrower an error like my thoughts are disappearing into then I'm now more focused on whatever I have to or must think or as in a bikini all over the place where is in the beginning I was all over the place

2025-08-17T14:23:10-03:00 — Beer at at five now and I started to feel my back the left side of my back hurting a little bit I think it's due to my posture

My left foot backwards backwards back part of my foot is starting to feel underneath my foot starting to feel a little bit of pain I'm also feeling a little bit of pain in my back part of my hips and

This is also the distance that I'm starting to feel my mouth dry and having to detect deep breaths have every 200 m or so but we are still talking my wife and I and we're still able to have a conversation so I think I think we're still fine so far 5 km in about one hour

***

2025-08-17T15:14:44-03:00 — Now I am at kilometer 91 hour and 45 minutes kilometer nine, at one hour and 45 minutes with a taste average pace of 11 minutes and 36 seconds.

Now my back hurts around five out of 10 it's not terrible but it's enough for me to remember every second that my back exists. I also didn't have lunch and now it's 3:14 PM so I had to have a banana. Coincidentally or not I feel like this was the most delicious banana I ever had.


2025-08-17T15:34:45-03:00 — I'm just crossed I just crossed 10.64 km with a pace pace of 11 minutes and 46 seconds and two hours and five minutes point. I think I am going to wrap up this one for today and go grab lunch cause it's almost 4 PM I haven't eaten anything ordered and I haven't eaten anything that banana that I mentioned above

2025-08-17T15:36:13-03:00 — By the way forgot to mention but my back is hurting and he gets it he got to I think I score of six out of 10 in the pain scale. I know it feels like you know when you have a bad night of sleep then you wake copy and your feeling your back is uncomfortable. Or? It's not good it's not an impossibility me it's not impossibility it's not preventing me from walking but it's or blocking me from advancing but it's really annoying it's annoying it feels like a small knife touching my skin anyway probably need to strengthen my back

**Logding:** I get a scary message by Craig Mod. I completely underestimated the scarcity of places to stay along the Nakahechi.

**The Japanese reservation system:** Using a Japanese website feels like time travel to the 90's. The [Tanabe prefecture website](https://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/2024/03/13/12612/), which intermediates reservations with the various village inns, doesn't work before 9am Japan time.

> The KUMANO TRAVEL Community Reservation Site is only open to receive new requests during set operational times: Daily 9:00 to 17:00 (Japan Standard Time).

I'm thankful I wasn't required to send them a fax.

reservei os guesthouses ao longo da trilha que a gente vai caminhar no Japão. que peso que saiu da consciencia. eu descobri, otimista com 45 dias de sobra, que todo mundo reserva com 6 meses de antecedencia, entao tinha sobrado só o fundo do tacho.

mas um lugar eu to orgulhoso de ter conseguido pegar: no dia zero pré-caminhada, vamos ficar num casébrio dum chef que é indicado Michelin (sem estrela), com fazenda própria. depois das infindáveis 8-9h de trem, só tem como chegar lá (e ir embora) de taxi.

ele produz tudo pro jantar e café da manhã. até as cabras pra produzir o próprio queijo

**T-40 days:** I get a detailed message from the Kawayu's guesthouse with everything they serve or don't. Unlucky me, dinners aren't served on Wednesdays.

## Elevation Reckoning
<span class="subtitle">
Realizing my walk had +1,000m / 3,600 ft of climb. 41 days to go, and I completely underestimated this walk.
</span>

I sip a cup of tea on a Wednesday, 9pm. Watching random thoughts run free in my mind, some walk-related, some are work-related, I recall how untrustworthy *Google Maps* is for plotting trails, and wonder how *Apple Maps* is doing on that front. A recent announcement promised hiking trails with higher precision.

<figure>
<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/t-37-0-shock-maps.jpeg" />
<figcaption>Apple Maps displays 3,608ft elevation</figcaption>
</figure>

"What?", I gasp. "A kilometer?", I incredulously stare at my screen for a few seconds while my head spins around. "That can't be right, *riiiight*!? This is Apple's new software, maybe it's a bug. 

I suddenly feel dumb for not checking that kind of very-critical-detail before. I mean, I'm flying to the opposite side the planet, watched dozens of videos, checked routes, bus lines and schedules over and over, but no, I skipped one of the most important parts.

I'm already at arms-length into this hike, lodging is booked, I can't give up. I won't give up. So I turn to Claude to get more details.

> Claude: Looking at the Kumano Kodo trail data, from Takijiri to Chikatsuyu involves approximately 1,010 meters of elevation gain over the ~14km distance.
> 
> You're looking at about 337 flights worth of elevation gai...

"337 flights of stairs?", I gasp again. That's... (counting on my fingers) climbing my apartment building 24 FREACKING TIMES. I'm faced by a monster bigger than me, a hill too tall to be conquered by someone who hasn't ever hiked. I'm also scared anticipating how my partner will hear this disturbing piece of news.

I can't give up, but I could definitely change the plans. I pursue that idea for... 2 seconds. I let that concept flash in my mind, only to realize retreating would leave me feeling unhappy and uncapable of doing what many thousands have already done. I mean, I could start off in Takahara, but it'd be flat and easy surface from there, would I feel proud of myself? This is not an Everest hike (that one is risky by definition), it's the Kumano Kodo; it doesn't look that big of a deal. So what's the real problem? Is it really impossible to do this hike? Or am I judging the situation prematurely? Maybe I just need more information before I can make a decision.

**Research mode**

"Ok, so, I need more guidance", I tell Claude. "I have roughly 30 days, I can walk on a flat surface for 15-20km. I don't seem to have enough time build up muscle to climb 300+ flights in a single session, but during the hike, I will not need to climb 300 in a single session anyway; it's distributed over 13km."

There's no size-fits-all and Claude doesn't know me, so I need a range of numbers to understand where I am. I continue, "What are the no-go, minimum, and ideal number of stairs that I need to be able to climb in a single session to train for this hike, considering that during the hike I will stop a few times for resting, and also for lunch? Let's be realistic."

> Claude: Given your 30-day timeline and current fitness (already walking 15-20km / 9-12 miles flat), here are realistic target for single sessions:
> - No-go: Less than 60 flights continuously without major distress
> - Minimum: 100-120 flights total (can break into sets of 20-30 with 2-3 min breaks)
> - Ideal: 150-180+ flights total in a session
> 
> You're right - you won't need 300+ continuous flights. The elevation is distributed over hours with natural breaks for views, photos, snacks. If you can do 150 flights in sets during training, you'll manage the hike.

I lack reference points, but 150 is a bit more reassuring than 300+. That looked impossible. This? Ugh, it's still 150 floors. I don't remember ever walking nowhere close to half that many. I remember walking up 17 floors to help out a friend during a power outage. I got up there and was sweating, but I remember feeling like I could do more in a life-or-death situation. Probably not 133 more. Not probably, certainly.

AI's can be exponentially more helpful when given details about time, place and your state of mind, so I share my schedule for maximum customization. I replace Claude with ChatGPT because it's better at cranking numbers. "*Week 1*, I'm in an apartment building with 14 flights of stairs; on *week 2*, I'm at a hotel in San Francisco (it has stairs); *weeks 3-4*, Airbnb without stairs in San Jose's Santana Row area, no idea about gyms; *week 5*, I'm attending a company offsite in Vail with access to gym; *week 6*, hike starts".

I get back a plan. The looks is surprisingly detailed, tailored to my precise needs.

> If you can string 120+ floors once a week (plus flat mileage) by mid-September, you’re realistically ready. Hitting 150+ gives peace of mind.
> 
> - Week 1 — 14-floor bldg: do 168 floors (total 6 loops, up only). 84 floors in 2 sessions. Walk down via elevator to save knees. Add 5 kg day-pack on 2nd session.
> - Week 2 — SF hotel: shoot for 100-120 total in 1 session. Target ≥ 120 floors. Add 1 shorter 60-floor lunch climb.
> - Weeks 3-4 — Santana Row, no stairs: if no gym is available, find a parking-garage (Valley Fair garage has 6-7 floors). Target 120 floors week 3, 150 week 4.
> - Week 5 — Vail, hotel gym + altitude: peak session: 160-180 floors continuous. Altitude makes lungs work, so keep heart rate below 80% max, and hydrate.
> - Week 6 — on trail: You’re tapering—just easy walks. Focus on sleep & nutrition.

I stand up and ask myself, "what am I doing"?

***

My partner needs to know what's going on. "Hey", I greet, "got a minute? I have good and bad news, which one do you wanna hear first?", I ask rhetorically, proceeding almost immediatelly: "The bad news is that on Day 1, we'll need to climb 1 kilometer". I pause, and she frowns with a face of calculation. "That's equivalent to 330 floors. Our building, times 24". She gives me a blank stare for a second or two, then begins laughing uncontrollably into a fetal position. "Wait, wait", I say, "there's good news: I have a plan".

# Exercise shock
<span class="subtitle">T-37 days to hike</span>

A superpower I've had since childhood is to be able to obsess over things, sometimes to my detriment, but most times for my own benefit. When in that state, fears and distraction are bypassed, and over the years I learned to channel that. Call me a nerd, but if concentrate in certain ways on an end-goal, I can turn on a kind of robotic discipline to get there. I can't explain why it works for me, but this ability helped me in key moments, from school and studying how to fix my lactose intolerance, to building my own company and getting clients in the US.

That obsession kicked in this week in full force. Once the reality of my miscalculation settled that Wednesday night, my mind could only see a picture of the mountains around Hongu with their lush forests, the carpets of stone laid out through dense cedar and cypress forests, guiding pilgrim's walks for thousands of years. I felt that the imagination, despite far into the distance, could someday be a reality in front me.

My hatred for exercising vanished the next morning. There was no procrastination, and the concept of pain felt secondary. I suspect that's a tiny bit how people like [David Goggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goggins) feel when running endless marathons. While I'd have given up sooner when lifting weights, that day I kept pushing to the final count while the Hongu Taisha Otorii flashes blinked in my mind. The exercising process had ceased from being an end in and of itself, and became a conduit, a means to a greater end. I had never felt that towards gym.

<img src="../images/posts/planning-a-walk-in-japan/t-37-gym-leg-day.jpg" alt="Gym leg day" />

Whenever thinking about the exercising I'd need to do, that thought was overlaid with the trail image I had to walk, all its tree roots and the rocky steps.

#### How much trouble am I in?

On August 22, I head to the ground floor after a workday, carrying my 1L sling bag with a water bottle, and start the climb. The first few floors go untroubled. After the 19th floor, I start breathing heavily and I need to be proactive about the rhythm. The soreness from yesterdays's workout joins me again, as if mocking my ascent. I laugh back.

My lower glutes punch me at every step. After every loop, I head down via elevator to preserve my knees (my focus is gaining muscle, not damaging my joints). After the 47th floor, small 20-30s pauses for breathing are necessary. The fight is ending, and after 37min, I complete 89 floors.

</gallery>

Eighty-nine-floors. It might look like nothing to you, or a lot, but I had not clue what to expect. I'm both jubilant that my first session finished above the *No-Go* threshold, and worried that it's below the *Minimum*. All in all, this is August 22, not September 22, so I'll keep my judgment in suspension for another month, but it looks much more doable and less scary now.

I laydown ice bags with trembling legs for my precious glutes.
